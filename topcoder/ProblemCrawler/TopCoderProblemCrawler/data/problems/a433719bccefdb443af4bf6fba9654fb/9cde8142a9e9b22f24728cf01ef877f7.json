	"statement":"<p>Little Dazdraperma likes graphs a lot. Recently she invented a new game for one person with graphs. Given a connected undirected graph with N vertices and a tree with N nodes (see the notes for definitions of all unclear terms from graph theory), she tries to place that tree on the graph in the following way:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Each node of the tree is put into correspondence with a vertex of the graph. Each node then corresponds to one vertex and each vertex corresponds to one node.</li> \n  <li>If there is an edge between two nodes of the tree then there must be an edge between the corresponding vertices in the graph.</li> \n </ul> Now Dazdraperma wonders how many ways are there to do such placement. Two placements are considered equal if each node of the tree corresponds to the same vertex of the graph in both placements. Return this number modulo 1000000007. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> The graph will be represented as String[] <b>graph</b> where j-th character in i-th element will be 'Y' if there is an edge between vertices i and j and 'N' otherwise. The tree will be given in the same way in String[] <b>tree</b>.",
