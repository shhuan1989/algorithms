	"statement":"<p>You are given a rectangular matrix with odd numbers of rows and columns. Each cell of the matrix contains either 0 or 1. In one move, you can select any one row or column of the matrix and replace all 0's with 1's and all 1's with 0's in that row/column. Your aim is to have an even number of 1's in each row and each column.</p> <p>The elements of the String[] <b>matrix</b> correspond to the rows of the matrix. Return the minimal number of moves needed to achieve your aim, or -1 if it's impossible.</p>",
