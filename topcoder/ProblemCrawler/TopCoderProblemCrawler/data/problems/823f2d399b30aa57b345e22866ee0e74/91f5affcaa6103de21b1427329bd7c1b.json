On each turn, a player may take T stones for any T in <b>turns</b>. For each number k between <b>m</b> and <b>n</b>, inclusive, the game is played once with the box containing k stones at the start of the game. Assuming both players play optimally, return how many times Bob will win (Bob always moves first). </p> ",
