	"statement":"TypoCoder is a programming contest like TopCoder. TypoCoder also has a rating system. There are two types of coders in TypoCoder: brown coders and ciel coders. A brown coder is a coder whose rating is greater than or equal to 2200. A ciel coder is a coder whose rating is less than 2200. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Cat Lower competes in TypoCoder. He is currently a ciel coder. His rating at the end of the current year is <b>X</b>. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Next year there will be some contests. In each of those contests, Cat Lower can either try his best or lose on purpose. For each i, the i-th contest (0-based index) has weight <b>D</b>[i]. If Cat Lower tries his best in the i-th contest, his rating will increase by <b>D</b>[i]. If he decides to lose on purpose instead, his rating will decrease by <b>D</b>[i], but not below zero. Formally, his rating will decrease by min(<b>D</b>[i],his rating before the contest). <br /><br /><br /><br /> Cat Lower loves being a ciel coder. Therefore, he must never be a brown coder twice in a row. That is, whenever Cat Lower becomes a brown coder, he must be ciel again after the next contest (if there are any contests left). <br /><br /><br /><br /> TypoCoder awards &quot;Chameleon coder of the year&quot; to the coder whose color changed the most times during the year. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given the int[] <b>D</b> and the int <b>X</b>. Return the maximal number of color changes Cat Lower can have next year. ",
