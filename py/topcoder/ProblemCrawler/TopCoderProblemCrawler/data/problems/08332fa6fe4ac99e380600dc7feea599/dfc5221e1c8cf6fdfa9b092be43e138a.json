	"statement":"<p> &quot;Rack 'em up!&quot; says Jane. She's beaten you at pool again, so you're stuck with the chore of racking the balls for the next game. There are fifteen balls at your disposal, numbered 1 through 15. Those numbered 1 through 7 are called &quot;solids&quot;, while 9 through 15 are &quot;stripes&quot;. Number 8, the &quot;eight-ball&quot;, is neither stripe nor solid. </p> <p> You are to arrange the balls into five rows such that the first row contains one ball; the second, two balls; and so on. The overall effect is that of an equilateral triangle pointing upward. For the purpose of this problem, we number the positions in the triangle from 0 to 14, starting in the first row and proceeding from left to right, top to bottom. The following piece of ASCII art shows the position numbers. </p> <pre>\n\n                                          0\n                                        1   2\n                                      3   4   5\n                                    6   7   8   9\n                                  10 11  12  13  14\n</pre> <p> In a correct rack, the eight-ball occupies position 4, while positions 10 and 14 may not be occupied by two stripes or two solids. Furthermore, you are at a pool hall whose rules dictate that stripes and solids alternate along the upper left side of the triangle (positions 10, 6, 3, 1, 0); along the fourth row (positions 6, 7, 8, 9); and along the first four positions in the bottom row (positions 10, 11, 12, 13). Finally, positions 5 and 9 must be occupied by two stripes or two solids. In effect, only two patterns of stripes and solids are possible. These patterns are shown below, using X to represent stripes, O for solids, and the numeral 8 for the eight-ball. </p> <pre>\n\n                         X                                O\n                       O   O                            X   X\n                     X   8   X                        O   8   O\n                   O   X   O   X                    X   O   X   O\n                 X   O   X   O   O                O   X   O   X   X\n</pre> <p> The balls are, at first, arranged randomly in the triangle. Etiquette demands that you change the configuration only by swapping the positions of two balls at a time. Any two balls, not merely an adjacent pair, may be swapped. Given a int[] describing the initial configuration of the triangle, so that the element at index 0 is the number of the ball at position 0 and so forth, what is the smallest number of swaps required to achieve a correct rack? </p>",
