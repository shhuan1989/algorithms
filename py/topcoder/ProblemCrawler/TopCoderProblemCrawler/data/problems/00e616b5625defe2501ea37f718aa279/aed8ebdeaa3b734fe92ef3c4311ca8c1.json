	"statement":" A primary limitation of fighter plane performance is the ability of the pilot to remain conscious. We have determined that pilots can withstand large accelerations for short time periods, but that they cannot handle an extended time period during which the average acceleration is high. <p> Create a class GForce that contains a method avgAccel that will be given the <b>period</b> as an int, and int[]'s <b>accel</b> and <b>time</b> giving a piecewise-linear approximation to the acceleration experienced over time during a flight. The method will return the greatest average acceleration experienced over any interval of length equal to <b>period</b>. The return value should be the average acceleration as a double. </p><p> The piecewise-linear acceleration function is given in order of increasing times, starting with the beginning of the flight and ending at the end of the flight. The graph of acceleration versus time is the sequence of straight-line segments joining adjacent points (time<sub>i</sub>, accel<sub>i</sub>). </p><p> The average acceleration over an interval is the area under the graph between the beginning and ending times, divided by the length of the interval. </p> ",
