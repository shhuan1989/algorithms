She now has some time and she would love to sing as many different songs as possible. <br /><br /> You are given a int[] <b>duration</b>. For each i, <b>duration</b>[i] is the duration of song i in Gumi's time units. <br /><br /> Gumi finds it difficult to sing songs with quite different tones consecutively. You are given a int[] <b>tone</b> with the following meaning: If Gumi wants to sing song y immediately after song x, she will need to spend |<b>tone</b>[x]-<b>tone</b>[y]| units of time resting between the two songs. (Here, || denotes absolute value.) <br /><br /> You are also given an int <b>T</b>. Gumi has <b>T</b> units of time for singing. She can start singing any song she knows immediately at the beginning of this time interval. Compute the maximal number of different songs she can sing completely within the given time. ",

Here is one way how she can sing three songs: First, she sings song 0 in 3 units of time. Second, she waits for |2-3|=1 unit of time and then sings song 2 in 4 units of time. Finally, she waits for |3-1|=2 units of time and then sings song 1 in 5 units of time. The total time spent is 3+1+4+2+5 = 15 units of time. ",
