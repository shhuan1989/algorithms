	"statement":"Consider a function randomInt(integer N) that takes an integer N and returns an integer uniformly at random in the range 0 to N-1. If that function is nested, as in randomInt(randomInt(N)), the probability distribution changes, and some numbers are more likely than others. Given an int <b>nestings</b> defining the number of times the function is nested (1 indicates randomInt(N), 2 indicates randomInt(randomInt(N)), and so on), an int <b>N</b> and an int <b>target</b>, return the probability that the result of <b>nestings</b> nested calls to randomInt with the parameter <b>N</b> will result in <b>target</b>.
