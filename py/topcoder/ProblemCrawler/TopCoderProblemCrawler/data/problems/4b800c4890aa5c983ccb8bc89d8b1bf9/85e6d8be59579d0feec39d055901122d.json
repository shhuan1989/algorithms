These may not display properly outside the applet.</i> <br /><br /><br /><br /> Manao is studying graph theory and simple cycles in particular. A simple cycle of length L ≥ 3 in graph G is a sequence of vertices (v<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>, ..., v<sub>L-1</sub>) such that all v<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>1</sub>, ..., v<sub>L-1</sub> are pairwise distinct and for each i=0..L-1, an edge between v<sub>i</sub> and v<sub>(i+1) mod L</sub> exists in G. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Manao is interested in graphs formed by connecting two trees. The connection process is as follows. Manao takes two trees composed of N vertices each. The vertices in each tree are labeled from 0 to N - 1. Then, he generates a permutation P of numbers from 0 to N - 1 uniformly at random. Finally, the graph is formed by connecting vertex i of the first tree to vertex P[i] of the second tree, for each i from 0 to N - 1. To remove ambiguity, the vertices of the first tree within the graph are referred to as A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, ..., A<sub>N-1</sub> and the vertices of the second graph are referred to as B<sub>0</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, ..., B<sub>N-1</sub>. Manao wants to know the expected number of simple cycles of length <b>K</b> in the resulting graph. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given two String[]s, <b>tree1</b> and <b>tree2</b>. Merge the elements of <b>tree1</b> to obtain a single string formatted as a space-separated list of N - 1 integers describing the first tree. Let x[i] denote the i-th integer (0-based index) in the list. Then, for each i, we have 0 ≤ x[i] ≤ i and in our tree the vertices x[i] and i+1 are connected by an edge. <b>tree2</b> describes the second tree in the same fashion. <br /><br /><br /><br />Compute and return the expected number of simple cycles of length <b>K</b> in the graph formed by connecting the two given trees as described above. Two simple cycles are equal if one of them can be cyclically shifted, or reversed and cyclically shifted, to coincide with the second. According to this definition, (1, 2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4, 1) and (3, 2, 1, 4) are all equal.",
