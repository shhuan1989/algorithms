	"statement":"In many sports, the time of possession is a much talked about statistic. This indicates the amount of time during a game that a particular team possesses the ball. In this problem, you will calculate the time of possession given the relevant events of the game. You will be given a String[], each element of which is formatted as &quot;EVENT TIME&quot;, where EVENT is either &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;SWITCH&quot;, or &quot;END&quot;. An &quot;A&quot; indicates that team A gains possession of the ball, while a &quot;B&quot; indicates that team B gains possession of the ball. &quot;SWITCH&quot; indicates that the ball changes possession from one team to the other (there are only two teams). &quot;END&quot; indicates the end of the game. Each TIME will be formatted as &quot;minutes:seconds&quot; where seconds contains exactly two digits, and minutes contains no extra leading zeros. Your task is to return a String formatted as &quot;minutes:seconds&quot; in the same format as the input, indicating the total time of possession for team A. The input will be sorted in non-descending order by time, and the first element will be either &quot;A 0:00&quot; or &quot;B 0:00&quot;, while the last element, and only the last element, will have EVENT = &quot;END&quot;.",
