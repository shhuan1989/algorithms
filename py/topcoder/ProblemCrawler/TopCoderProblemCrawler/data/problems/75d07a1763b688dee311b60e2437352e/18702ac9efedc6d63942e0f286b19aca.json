	"statement":"<pre>Class Name: Derivatives\nMethod Name: calcDerivative\nParameters: String,int,int\nReturns: int\n\nImplement a class Derivatives which contains a method calcDerivative.  The\nmethod takes a String representing a polynomial, and two ints, k and x.  The\nmethod returns the kth derivative of the polynomial evaluated at x.\n\nThe first derivative of any term of a polynomial is:\n1st derivative of (a*x^n) = (a*n*x^(n-1)).\n\nThe first derivative of any polynomial is the sum of the first derivatives of\nthe polynomial's terms.\nThe kth derivative of a polynomial is the 1st derivative of the (k-1)th\nderivative of the polynomial.\nThe 0th derivative of a polynomial is the polynomial itself.\n\nThe String will be of the form:\n&quot;a1*x^n1+a2*x^n2+....&quot;\nThere are no spaces.\nAll the a's are non-negative integers less than 20\nAll the n's are unique non-negative integers less than 10.\nThe String is at most 50 characters and at least 5 characters.\n\nHere is the method signature:\npublic int calcDerivative(String poly,int k,int x);\n\npoly is of the correct form.\nk is an integer between 0 and 10, inclusive.\nx is an integer between -10 and 10, inclusive.\n\nExamples:\n*If poly=&quot;3*x^3+2*x^1+2*x^0&quot;, k=1, and x=1:\nThe first derivative is: 3*3*x^(3-1)+2*1*x^(1-1)+0*2*x^(0-1)=9*x^2+2*x^0.\nThe first derivative evaluated at x=1 is: 9*1^2+2*1^0=11\nSo the method returns 11.\n\n*If poly=&quot;2*x^5+3*x^2&quot;, k=2, and x=-2,\nThe first derivative is: 5*2*x^(5-1)+3*2*x^(2-1)=10*x^4+6*x^1.\nThe second derivative is: 10*4*x^(4-1)+6*1*x^(1-1)=40*x^3+6*x^0.\nThe second derivative evaluated at x=-2 is 40*(-2)^3+6*(-2)^0=-314.\nSo the method returns -314.\n</pre>",
