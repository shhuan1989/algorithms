	"statement":"Some jewels are placed in a rectangular grid on an infinite plane. You are given String[] <b>jewels</b> describing the jewels. If the j-th character of the i-th element of <b>jewels</b> is 'R', 'G' or 'B', there is a red, green or blue jewel at the center of the j-th cell of the i-th row of the grid, respectively. Jewels of the same color cannot be distinguished. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Alice draws two squares on this plane. Their sides must be parallel to the axis and have length <b>k</b>. She is allowed to draw squares so that some part of them are on the outside of the grid. Then she will get the jewels which lie in the <i>inside</i> of at least one of the two squares. Note that the <i>inside</i> of a square does not contain its boundary. She wants to make a chain of jewels, using some of the jewels she will get. She does not have to use all of the jewels she will get. A chain is a row of one or more jewels. Chains are non-directional. For example, chains R-G-B and B-G-R are considered equal. How many different chains are possible, considering all the chains from all possible square locations? Return the answer modulo 1,000,000,009. ",
