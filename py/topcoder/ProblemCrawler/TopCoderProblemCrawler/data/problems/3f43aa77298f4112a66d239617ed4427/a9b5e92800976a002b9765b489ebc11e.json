	"statement":"Homes typically have 20 amp fuses in their fuseboxes. Appliances are then hooked up to the fuses. If the appliances connected to a single fuse ever draw more than 20 amps, the fuse will blow (which you would like to avoid). In large homes with a large number of appliances, multiple 20 amp fuses may be required to accommodate all of the appliances. You have a number of large appliances, each of which must be connected to some fuse. The number of amps used by each appliance will be given by <b>amps</b>. Your task is to find the minimum number of 20 amp fuses that can accommodate all of the appliances.",
