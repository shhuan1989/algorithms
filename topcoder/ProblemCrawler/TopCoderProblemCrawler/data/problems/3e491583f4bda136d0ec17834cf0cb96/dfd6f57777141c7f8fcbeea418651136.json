	"statement":"<p>When people whisper to each other in the TopCoder arena, they type &quot;/msg &lt;username&gt; &lt;message&gt;&quot; (quotes and angle brackets for clarity only). However, TopCoder allows users to have spaces in their names. This leads to some ambiguity in regards to who a whisper is actually addressed to. For examples if a user types in &quot;/msg John Doe hi there&quot;, this could interpreted in a number of ways. It could be that the user is trying to send the message &quot;Doe hi there&quot; to a user named &quot;John&quot; or it could be that the message is to a user &quot;John Doe&quot;, and has content &quot;hi there&quot;. </p><p> To figure this out you should take a list of users who are logged in, and determine, of the users that the message could possibly be to, which one has the longest name. It may only be to a user if it starts exactly with &quot;/msg &lt;username&gt; &quot;. That is, &quot;/msg &quot; followed by a single space, followed by the user's handle, followed by another space. Thus, if someone typed in &quot;/msg John Doe hi there&quot; and the people logged in were {&quot;John&quot;,&quot;John Doe&quot;,&quot;John Doe h&quot;}, the message could be to either &quot;John Doe&quot; or &quot;John&quot; (but not &quot;John Doe h&quot; because there is not a space following his handle in the typed string). Of those two, &quot;John Doe&quot; has the longer name, so we assume it is to him. </p><p> Additionally, all whispering is case insensitive, so &quot;/msg John Doe hi there&quot; will go to the same person as &quot;/MSG jOHN dOE HI THERE&quot;. </p> <p> If there is no user who the message could be to return &quot;user is not logged in&quot; (see examples) <br /><br /> If <b>typed</b> does not begin with &quot;/msg &quot; return &quot;not a whisper&quot; (note that there is a space at the end of &quot;/msg &quot;). </p>",
