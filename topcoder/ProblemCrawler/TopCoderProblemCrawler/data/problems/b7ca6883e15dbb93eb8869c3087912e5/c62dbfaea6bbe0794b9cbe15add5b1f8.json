	"statement":"Fox Ciel is playing a board game with her friend Squirrel Liss. The game is played on an infinite strip of paper. The strip of paper is divided into consecutive cells. Each cell has an integer coordinate. Formally, for each integer i, the left neighbor of cell i is cell (i-1) and the right neighbor of cell i is cell (i+1). <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Each of the players has a single token called the fencer. At the beginning of the game, Ciel's fencer is in cell 0 and Liss's fencer is in cell <b>d</b>. Each of the fencers has two limits: its maximum move length and its hitting range. For Ciel's fencer the maximum move length is <b>mov1</b> and the hitting range is <b>rng1</b>. Similarly, for Liss's fencer we have the parameters <b>mov2</b> and <b>rng2</b>. Note that the parameters of Liss's fencer may differ from the ones of Ciel's fencer. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> The players take alternating turns. Ciel goes first. In each turn the current player starts by moving her fencer. The distance between the original cell and the destination cell must be at most equal to the fencer's maximum move length. (It is also allowed to leave the fencer in the same cell.) Then, the current player checks whether the other fencer lies within the hitting range - that is, whether the current distance between the fencers is at most equal to the current fencer's hitting range. If that is the case, the game ends and the current player wins. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You are given the ints <b>mov1</b>, <b>mov2</b>, <b>rng1</b>, <b>rng2</b>, and <b>d</b>. Return &quot;Ciel&quot; (quotes for clarity) if Fox Ciel has a winning strategy, &quot;Liss&quot; if Squirrel Liss has a winning strategy, and &quot;Draw&quot; otherwise.",
