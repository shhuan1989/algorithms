	"statement":"Two sequences A and B are called <i>similar</i> if they are both non-empty, have the same length, and have the following property: we can obtain two identical sequences by deleting one element of A and one element of B. (The deleted elements do not necessarily have to have the same index. The order of the remaining elements in each sequence has to be preserved.) <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given a int[] <b>seq</b> and a int <b>bound</b>. Consider all sequences such that each element is an integer between 1 and <b>bound</b>, inclusive. Count how many of such sequences are similar to <b>seq</b>. Return this count modulo 1,000,000,009.",
