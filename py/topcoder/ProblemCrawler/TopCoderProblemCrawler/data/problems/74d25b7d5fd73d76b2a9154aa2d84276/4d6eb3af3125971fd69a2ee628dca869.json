	"statement":"<p><i> After the Challenge Phase of TCO 2014 round 2C ended, I realized that I probably wouldn't get into top 50. With the best place I'd ever gotten in an SRM, however, it would've been possible. Aargh, why can't I just swap them... but what about making another problem out of this situation? </i></p> <br /><br /> <p> Bonif&aacute;c is going to compete in a tournament with <tt>N</tt> online rounds, numbered <tt>0</tt> through <tt>N-1</tt> in no particular order. Unlike the TCO, each contestant may compete officially in all online rounds. However, only contestants who finished among the top <tt><b>cutoff</b>[i]</tt> participants of round <tt>i</tt> for all <tt>0 &lt;= i &lt; N</tt> are invited to the onsite finals. </p> <br /><br /> <p> Bonif&aacute;c wants to compete in the onsite finals. For that, he assessed his skills and determined that if he competed in round <tt>i</tt>, he'd take the <tt><b>places</b>[i]</tt>-th place. This might not be sufficient, but Bonif&aacute;c is able to select any subset of elements of <tt><b>places</b></tt> and reorder them in any way (don't think too deeply into how he'd do it). However, such a feat is very difficult, so he wants to perform it on as few elements as possible. </p> <br /><br /> <p> You're given int[]s <tt><b>cutoff</b></tt> and <tt><b>places</b></tt>. Return the smallest non-negative integer <tt>K</tt>, such that Bonif&aacute;c could advance to the onsite finals after reordering (permuting) his results in <tt>K</tt> online rounds. Formally, for Bonif&aacute;c to advance, there have to be <tt>K</tt> elements of <tt><b>places</b></tt>, such that after rearranging them into a different order, <tt><b>places</b>[i] &lt;= <b>cutoff</b>[i]</tt> would hold for all <tt>0 &lt;= i &lt; N</tt>. If no such <tt>K</tt> exists, return <tt>-1</tt> instead. </p>",
