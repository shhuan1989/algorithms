	"statement":"Slow loris Guts is playing with N cards, numbered 0 through N-1. Each card has one of four colors: red, green, blue, or white. You are given the card colors as the String <b>C</b>. For each i, character i of <b>C</b> is one of 'R' (red), 'G' (green), 'B' (blue), and 'W' (white). <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are also given an int <b>M</b>. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Guts wants to color each white card red, green, or blue in such a way that the number of cards <i>not</i> colored blue is exactly 2*D*<b>M</b> for some non-negative integer D. Additionally, there must be exactly <b>M</b> sequences of integers S_0 through S_{<b>M</b>-1} with the following properties: <br /><br /> \n <ul> \n  <li>For each i, the sequence S_i contains exactly 2*D integers, each of them between 0 and <b>N</b>-1, inclusive.</li> \n  <li>For each i, the sequence S_i is strictly increasing. That is, S_i[0] &lt; S_i[1] &lt; ... &lt; S_i[2*D-1].</li> \n  <li>For each i and each even j, the card S_i[j] is red.</li> \n  <li>For each i and each odd j, the card S_i[j] is green.</li> \n  <li>No two sequences share a common element. Hence, for each index x of a non-blue card there is precisely one pair (i,j) such that S_i[j]=x.</li> \n </ul> Return the number of valid ways to color all white cards, modulo 1,000,000,007.",
