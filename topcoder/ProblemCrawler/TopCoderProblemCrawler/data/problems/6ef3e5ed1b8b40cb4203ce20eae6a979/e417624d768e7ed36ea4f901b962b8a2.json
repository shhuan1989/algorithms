	"statement":"<p> Two sequences A and B are called similar if they have the same length and have the following property: we can obtain two identical sequences by deleting at most two elements of A and at most two elements of B. (The elements deleted from A don't have to have the same indices as the elements deleted from B. The order of the remaining elements in each sequence has to be preserved.) </p> <p> You are given ints <b>N</b> and <b>bound</b>. Consider all the sequences with length <b>N</b> such that each element is an integer between 1 and <b>bound</b>, inclusive. Compute the number of ordered pairs of such sequences that are similar. Return this count modulo 1,000,000,009. </p> ",
