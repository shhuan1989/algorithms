	"statement":"Fox Ciel and Fox Jiro both went to spend an evening in the dancing room. Together, there are N foxes in the room. The foxes are numbered 0 through N-1. In particular, Ciel is fox 0 and Jiro is fox 1. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You are given a String[] <b>friendship</b> that describes the initial friendship between the foxes in the room. More precisely, <b>friendship</b> contains N elements with N characters each. Character j of element i of <b>friendship</b> is 'Y' if foxes i and j are friends at the beginning of the evening, and 'N' otherwise. Note that friendship is symmetric: whenever X is a friend of Y, Y is a friend of X. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> During the evening, multiple songs will be played in succession. During each song, some pairs of foxes will be dancing together. Foxes are not allowed to change partners during the dance. Thus in each dance each fox either dances with a single partner, or sits the dance out. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Foxes are not allowed to form the pairs for a dance arbitrarily. It is only allowed for two foxes to dance together if they are friends, or if they have a common friend who can introduce them. That is, if foxes A and B are not friends at the moment, they can only dance together if there is a fox C such that A and B are both friends with C. After two foxes dance together, they become friends. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Fox Ciel wants to become friends with Fox Jiro. Return the smallest number of dances in which this can be achieved (assuming that all other foxes cooperate and form pairs for the dances optimally). If it's impossible to make Ciel and Jiro friends, return -1 instead.",
