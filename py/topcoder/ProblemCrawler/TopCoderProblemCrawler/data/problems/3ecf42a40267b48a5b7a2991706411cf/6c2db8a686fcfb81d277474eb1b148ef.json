	"statement":"In the past, whole organizations depended on a single, big computer to do all the computational work. In a particular case, a computer has a list of pending jobs which is described by int[] <b>duration</b> and String[] <b>user</b>, each with n elements. <b>duration</b>[i] is the total time in minutes required to complete the i-th job and <b>user</b>[i] is a string that identifies the user that requested that job. A user may request multiple jobs. The computer may only process one job at a time. The waiting time for a user is defined as the time that this user has to wait before all of the jobs (s)he requested are finished. The computer will always pick a schedule to process the jobs in such a way that the average of waiting times over all users is minimized. If there are multiple schedules that can accomplish the minimum average waiting time, the computer will pick any of them with equal probability.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> We need a way to estimate how long the computer will take to finish each of the jobs. Your method must return a double[] containing n elements. The i-th element of your return must be the expected time in minutes before the computer finishes processing the i-th job.",
