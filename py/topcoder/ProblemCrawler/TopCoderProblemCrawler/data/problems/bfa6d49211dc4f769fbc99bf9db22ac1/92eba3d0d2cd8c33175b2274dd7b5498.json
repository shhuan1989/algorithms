	"statement":"You are playing a computer game and a big fight is planned between two armies. You and your computer opponent will line up your respective units in two rows, with each of your units facing exactly one of your opponent's units and vice versa. Then, each pair of units, who face each other will fight and the stronger one will be victorious, while the weaker one will be captured. If two opposing units are equally strong, your unit will lose and be captured. You know how the computer will arrange its units, and must decide how to line up yours. You want to maximize the sum of the strengths of your units that are not captured during the battle. <br /><br /> You will be given a int[] <b>you</b> and a int[] <b>computer</b> that specify the strengths of the units that you and the computer have, respectively. The return value should be an int, the maximum total strength of your units that are not captured.",
