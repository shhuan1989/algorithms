	"statement":"<p> A set of points in 3D is called a <i>sub-cube</i> if it is the subset of vertices of some cube in 3D. The cube may be rotated arbitrarily. Note that any non-empty sub-cube will contain between 1 and 8 points, inclusive. </p> <p> You are given int[]s <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>, and <b>Z</b>, each containing N elements. These int[]s describe a set of N distinct points in 3D: for each valid i, there is a point at (<b>X</b>[i], <b>Y</b>[i], <b>Z</b>[i]). </p> <p> Return the number of non-empty subsets of the N points that are sub-cubes. </p> ",
