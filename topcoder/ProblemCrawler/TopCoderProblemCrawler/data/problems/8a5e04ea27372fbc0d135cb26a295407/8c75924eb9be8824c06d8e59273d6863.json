	"statement":"<p>Let P be a set of an even number of distinct points on the plane. A <i>vector matching</i> V of set P is a set of vectors where each vector starts at one point in P and ends at another, and each point in P is either the head or tail of exactly one vector in the matching. Thus, there are half as many vectors in V as there are points in P.</p> <p>You are given int[]s <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>, where (<b>x</b>[i], <b>y</b>[i]) are the coordinates of the i-th point of P. Find a vector matching V for set P such that the length of the vector sum of the vectors in V is minimal, and return this length.</p>",
