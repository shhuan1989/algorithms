	"statement":"<p>Soundex is a phonetic algorithm, meaning that it indexes words by their pronunciation (in English). The algorithm transforms an input string of letters into a code of the form <i>Cddd</i>, where <i>C</i> is an uppercase letter and each <i>d</i> character represents a digit between 0 and 6, inclusive.</p> <p>The variant of Soundex we will be using works as follows: </p>\n <ol> \n  <li>Remember the first letter of the input string.</li> \n  <li>Remove all H and W characters.</li> \n  <li>Replace each letter in the word with its <i>phonetic code</i>, given in the following table: <pre>   A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n   0 1 2 3 0 1 2 - 0 2 2 4 5 5 0 1 2 6 2 3 0 1 - 2 0 2</pre> </li> \n  <li>Compress runs consisting of the same digit, leaving only one occurrence.</li> \n  <li>Remove all occurrences of the digit zero.</li> \n  <li>Truncate the result or pad it with zeros from the right so that the resulting code is exactly four characters long (for example, the string <tt>123456</tt> would be truncated to <tt>1234</tt>, while the string <tt>43</tt> would be padded with zeros to form <tt>4300</tt>).</li> \n  <li>Replace the first digit by the letter remembered in the first step.</li> \n </ol> <p></p> <p>For example, let's run through the algorithm with the word <tt>SOMEWHERE</tt>: </p>\n <ol> \n  <li>We remember the letter S as we will need to restore it later.</li> \n  <li>Removing the H and W characters yields <tt>SOMEERE</tt>.</li> \n  <li>Replacing letters with their phonetic codes results in <tt>2050060</tt>.</li> \n  <li>Compressing groups of consecutive codes gives <tt>205060</tt>.</li> \n  <li>Removing all zeros, we get <tt>256</tt>.</li> \n  <li>Padding the result with a single zero gives <tt>2560</tt>.</li> \n  <li>Restoring the first letter gives the final <tt>S560</tt>.</li> \n </ol> <p></p> <p>Find the number of distinct words of length <b>length</b>, consisting only of letters of the English alphabet, for which the above algorithm yields the given Soundex code <b>soundex</b>.</p>",
