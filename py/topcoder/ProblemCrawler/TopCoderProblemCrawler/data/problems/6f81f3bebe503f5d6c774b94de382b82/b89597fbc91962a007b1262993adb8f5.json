	"statement":"<pre>Class Name: DigitArrange\nMethod Name: targetDiff\nParameters: int\nReturns: int\n\nImplement a class DigitArrange which contains a method targetDiff.  The method\nis passed two ints as parameters: a source and a target.  The method rearranges\nthe digits of the source to two distinct integers whose difference magnitude is\nas close to without exceeding the target as possible.  The method returns the\nmagnitude of this difference.\n\nHere is the method signature:\npublic int targetDiff(int source,int target);\n\nThe source is between 10 and 999999, inclusive.\nThe target is between 1 and 999999, inclusive.\n\nNote:\n-If it is impossible not to exceed the target, the method returns -1.\n-Any 0s to the left of all non-zero digits in the source are not digits in\nsource.\n-However, when arranging the digits of source, the first digit(s) of the\narranged value can be 0.\n-One of the rearranged values may equal the source.\n\nExamples:\n-If the source is 981 and the target is 50, the two distinct values yielding\nthe difference's magnitude closest to the target are 918 and 891.  The\ndifference is 27 and the method returns 27.\n-If the source is 450 and the target is 9, the two distinct values yielding the\ndifference's magnitude closest to the target are 045 and 054.  The method\nreturns the difference, 9.\n-If the source is 100 and the target is 2, there is no way to arrange the\nsource's digits to get two distinct numbers whose difference is less than 2, so\nthe method returns -1.\n</pre>",
