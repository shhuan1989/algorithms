	"statement":"Alice is playing a game with her old friend, Bob. <br /><br /> There are n circles on a paper. The center of the i-th circle is (<b>x</b>[i], <b>y</b>[i]), and the radius is <b>r</b>[i]. No two different circles share a common point on their boundary. However, it is allowed for circles to be located entirely within other circles. In the game, the players take alternating turns. Alice starts. In each move, the current player must: \n <ol> \n  <li>Choose a circle such that there is no red point strictly inside the circle.</li> \n  <li>Pick one point that is strictly inside the chosen circle and color it red.</li> \n </ol> If a player can't do such a move, he/she loses the game. <br /><br /> You are given the int[]s <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, and <b>r</b> that describe a set of circles with the above property. Return &quot;Alice&quot; (quotes for clarity) if Alice has a winning strategy for the given set of circles. Otherwise, return &quot;Bob&quot;. ",
