	"statement":"<p>The players A and B are playing a game with dice. Player A throws <b>numDiceA</b> of his dice, while player B throws <b>numDiceB</b> of his dice. Each of them adds the pips on his dice, and the player with the higher sum wins the game (if both get the same sum, it is a draw). The variables <b>sidesA</b> and <b>sidesB</b> have 6 elements each, and describe how many pips are on each side of the dice of player A and player B respectively. Each die has exactly 1/6 probability for each possible outcome.</p> <p>Given the number of dice <b>numDiceA</b> and <b>numDiceB</b> each player throws, and their configurations <b>sidesA</b> and <b>sidesB</b>, compute the probability that player A wins the game.</p> ",
