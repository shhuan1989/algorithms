	"statement":"Given is a positive integer <b>W</b>. We will use <b>W</b> to define a function f. The value f(x) is computed as follows: \n <ul> \n  <li>If x is not a positive integer, f(x) is undefined.</li> \n  <li>Let y = x modulo <b>W</b>. If y is zero, f(x) is undefined.</li> \n  <li>Otherwise, f(x) = x/y (where &quot;/&quot; denotes exact real division).</li> \n </ul> For any positive integer x, consider the following infinite sequence: x, f(x), f(f(x)), f(f(f(x))), and so on. We say that f is always defined for x if all the terms of the above sequence are defined. (In other words, there is no positive integer k such that f^k(x) is undefined. Here, f^k denotes f applied k times.) <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given longs <b>L</b> and <b>R</b>, and the int <b>W</b> used in our function f. Count all x between <b>L</b> and <b>R</b>, inclusive, such that f is always defined for x. Return that count. ",
