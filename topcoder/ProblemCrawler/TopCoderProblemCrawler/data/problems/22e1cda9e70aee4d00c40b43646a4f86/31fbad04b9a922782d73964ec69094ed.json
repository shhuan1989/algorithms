	"statement":"<p> An important problem in DNA analysis is finding <i>tandem repeats</i>. A tandem repeat occurs when a base sequence of nucleotides appears twice in a row. (In this problem, a base sequence is simply a contiguous substring and a nucleotide is simply a letter.) For example, in the DNA sequence &quot;GATCATCA&quot;, the base sequence &quot;ATC&quot; appears twice in a row. In contrast, &quot;ATCGATC&quot; is not a tandem repeat of the base sequence &quot;ATC&quot; because of the 'G' in between the two copies. </p> <p> Real DNA often contains errors in which one nucleotide is substituted for another. A <b>k</b>-approximate tandem repeat occurs when a base sequence of nucleotides appears twice in a row, allowing the second copy of the base sequence to differ from the first copy in at most <b>k</b> nucleotides. For example, in the DNA sequence &quot;GATCATGA&quot;, the base sequence &quot;ATC&quot; is immediately repeated with a single error as &quot;ATG&quot;. Thus, &quot;ATCATG&quot; is a 1-approximate tandem repeat. Note that both copies of the base sequence must be the same length. </p> <p> Given a DNA sequence <b>dna</b> (represented as a String) and a limit <b>k</b> on the number of errors, find the length of the longest sequence that appears in <b>dna</b> as the base sequence of a <b>k</b>-approximate tandem repeat. Note that a <b>k</b>-approximate tandem repeat contains <i>at most</i> <b>k</b> errors, but it is allowed to contain fewer errors. </p> ",
