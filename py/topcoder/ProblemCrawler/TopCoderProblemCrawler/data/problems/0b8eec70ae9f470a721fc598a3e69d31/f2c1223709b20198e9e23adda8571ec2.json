This is a common typing error that can be fiendishly difficult to spot. <p> After making this error one too many times, you have decided to build a tool to detect such errors automatically. Given a String[] <b>lines</b>, you are to return the zero-based index of the first line whose last word is the same as the first word on the next line, or -1 if there is no such line. Each line contains one or more words separated by spaces. Words are composed of uppercase and lowercase letters ('A'-'Z' and 'a'-'z'). Two words are considered the same if they are exactly equal, including capitalization. </p> ",
