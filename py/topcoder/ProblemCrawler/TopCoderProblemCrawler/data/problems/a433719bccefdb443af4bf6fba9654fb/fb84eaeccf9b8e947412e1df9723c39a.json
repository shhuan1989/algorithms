	"statement":"Little Dazdraperma likes graphs a lot. Recently she invented a new game for one person with graphs. She is given a connected undirected graph with N vertices numbered 0 to N-1, inclusive (see the notes for definitions of all unclear terms from graph theory). Each edge of the graph is labeled with a positive integer length. She tries to remove some edges (possibly 0) so that the resulting graph satisfies the following conditions: \n <ul> \n  <li>The graph that remains is a tree with exactly N-1 edges.</li> \n  <li>For each v, 0 &lt; v &lt; N, the shortest distance between vertex 0 and vertex v is the same in the resulting graph and in the initial graph.</li>\n </ul> Dazdraperma wonders how many different resulting graphs that satisfy these conditions she can obtain. Two graphs are considered different if there are two different vertices such that one of the graphs contains an edge between these two vertices and another graph doesn't contain an edge between them. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You are given the representation of the initial graph as a String[] <b>graph</b>. This String[] contains exactly N elements and each element contains exactly N characters. The j-th character in the i-th element will be '0' if there is no edge between vertices i and j. Otherwise, it will be a character between '1' and '9' representing the length of the edge between vertices i and j. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Return the number of possible resulting graphs modulo 1000000007.",
