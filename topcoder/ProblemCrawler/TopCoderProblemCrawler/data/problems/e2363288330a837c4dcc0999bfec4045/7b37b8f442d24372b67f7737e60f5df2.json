	"statement":"<p>A card shuffling machine is a device designed to randomize the order of a deck of cards. A particularly poor (but unfortunately relatively common) design of machine works as follows: an integer N is selected uniformly at random between 1 and <b>maxShuffles</b>, inclusive, and a series of N exactly similar deterministic shuffles are performed. A deterministic shuffle is a fixed permutation of the cards. The randomness of the resulting ordering is clearly therefore only dependent on the number of shuffles chosen. After the deck has been shuffled N times, the cards are distributed to the players.</p> <p>A particularly dishonest player has decided that he wishes to cheat. He has identified <b>K</b> cards in the deck that he wants to receive when the cards are distributed. He has managed to figure out both the fixed shuffle that the machine uses and also the maximum number of shuffles chosen. The fixed shuffle is given in a int[] <b>shuffle</b>, in which element i gives the position after the shuffle of the card that was initially in position i (both 0-based). The positions in the deck of the cards the player will receive after they have been shuffled are given in <b>cardsReceived</b> (0-based). Before the cards are shuffled, the player can order them in any way he wishes. Determine the initial ordering that will maximize the expected number of the <b>K</b> desired cards that he will receive and return this expected number.</p>",
