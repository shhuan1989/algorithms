	"statement":"F is a function that is defined on all real numbers from the closed interval [1,N]. You are given a int[] <b>Y</b> with N elements. For each i (1 &lt;= i &lt;= N) we have F(i) = <b>Y</b>[i-1]. Additionally, you know that F is piecewise linear: for each i, on the interval [i,i+1] F is a linear function. The function F is uniquely determined by this information. For example, if F(4)=1 and F(5)=6 then we must have F(4.7)=4.5. <br /><br /><br /><br /> As another example, this is the plot of the function F for <b>Y</b> = {1, 4, -1, 2}. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/PiecewiseLinearFunction/2zecd35.png\" /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> Given a real number y, we can count the number of solutions to the equation F(x)=y. For example, for the function plotted above there are 0 solutions for y=7, there is 1 solution for y=4, and there are 3 solutions for y=1.1. We are looking for the largest number of solutions such an equation can have. For the function plotted above the answer would be 3: there is no y such that F(x)=y has more than 3 solutions. <br /><br /><br /><br /> If there is an y such that the equation F(x)=y has infinitely many solutions, return -1. Otherwise, return the maximum possible number of solutions such an equation may have. ",
