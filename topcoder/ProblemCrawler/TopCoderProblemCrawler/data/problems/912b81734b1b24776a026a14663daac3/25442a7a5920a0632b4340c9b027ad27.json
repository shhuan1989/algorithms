	"statement":"The currency system in Colorland consists of various types of coins. The coin denominations follow these simple rules: \n <ul> \n  <li>The denominations are distinct positive integers.</li> \n  <li>There is a coin type with denomination 1.</li> \n  <li>For each pair of different coin types, the denomination of one coin type divides the denomination of the other one.</li> \n </ul> You are given a long[] <b>values</b> containing all the available denominations in ascending order. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Coins of different denominations look exactly the same except that they have different colors. Each coin in Colorland has exactly one color. The coin colors follow these even simpler rules: \n <ul> \n  <li>All coins of the same type are of the same color.</li> \n  <li>No two coins of different types are of the same color.</li> \n </ul> You know all coin denominations used in Colorland, but you don't know their colors. You don't even know the set of colors used on the coins. <br /><br /><br /><br /> For each denomination, you'd like to know the color of coins of this denomination. To accomplish this, you've got a credit card with an infinite amount of money. You can perform queries to an ATM which can also provide you with an infinite amount of money. Each query is described by a positive integer X, which means that you want to receive exactly X units of money from the ATM. The ATM will provide you with the requested amount. You also know that the requested amount will be paid using the smallest possible number of coins. (Note that this rule always uniquely determines the set of coins chosen to make the payment.) <br /><br /><br /><br /> Return the smallest number of queries you need to determine the corresponding color for each of the denominations. (Note that this can always be done in a finite number of queries.) ",
