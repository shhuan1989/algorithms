	"statement":"<p> <i>NOTE: This problem statement contains subscripts and superscripts which may not display properly for plugin users.</i> <br /><br /> </p> <p> Write a program to generate a list of random 3D points in space, and then compute the distance between the pair of closest points. Also determine how many distinct pairs of points are this exact distance apart. </p> <p> Generate the random points using the following pseudo-random number generator. Starting with a given <i>seed<sub>0</sub></i>: </p> <pre>\n    <i>seed<sub>i+1</sub></i> = (<i>seed<sub>i</sub></i> * 16807) mod (2<sup>31</sup>-1)\n</pre> <p> The <i>i</i>th random number (starting at <i>i</i> = 1) is given by: </p> <pre>\n    <i>rand<sub>i</sub></i> = (<i>seed<sub>i</sub></i> mod (2 * range)) - range\n</pre> <p> The 3D points are triples of 3 successive random numbers: </p> <pre>\n    (<i>rand<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>rand<sub>2</sub></i>, <i>rand<sub>3</sub></i>)\n    (<i>rand<sub>4</sub></i>, <i>rand<sub>5</sub></i>, <i>rand<sub>6</sub></i>)\n    (<i>rand<sub>7</sub></i>, <i>rand<sub>8</sub></i>, <i>rand<sub>9</sub></i>)\n    (<i>rand<sub>10</sub></i>, <i>rand<sub>11</sub></i>, <i>rand<sub>12</sub></i>)\n    etc...\n</pre> <p> You will be given an initial <b>seed</b>, the <b>range</b>, and <b>N</b> (the number of points). The random numbers produced by the generator will be between -<b>range</b> and <b>range</b>-1, inclusive. Return a int[] with two elements: the first element should be the square of the distance between the pair of closest points, and the second element should be the number of distinct pairs of points that have this same squared distance. </p> <p> <i>NOTE: Be sure to use 64-bit arithmetic for the multiply and mod in the random-number generator, and for computing squared distances.</i> </p> ",
