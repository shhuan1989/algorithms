	"statement":"<p> You are given two Strings, <b>first</b> and <b>second</b>. Each of these strings contains a simple linear equation with variables x and y. Your task is to determine whether this pair of equations has a unique solution, and if so, to compute it. </p> <p> Each of the equations is of the form &quot;<tt>A*X + B*Y = C</tt>&quot;. The spaces must appear exactly as in this example, i.e., there is exactly one space both before and after the signs &quot;<tt>+</tt>&quot; and &quot;<tt>=</tt>&quot;, and there are no other spaces. The coefficients <tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>, and <tt>C</tt> are integers. If a coefficient is non-negative, the equation contains just the number, without the unary plus sign. If a coefficient is negative, it is <i>always</i> enclosed in parentheses, and it contains the unary minus sign. No coefficient will contain unnecessary leading zeroes. </p> <p> If the pair of equations has a unique solution, return the solution formatted as a String of the form &quot;<tt>X=A/B Y=C/D</tt>&quot;, where <tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>, <tt>C</tt>, and <tt>D</tt> are integers such that both fractions <tt>A/B</tt> and <tt>C/D</tt> are reduced, and the numbers <tt>B</tt> and <tt>D</tt> are positive. The numbers should be encoded in the same way as the coefficients of the equations -- i.e., negative numbers must be enclosed in parentheses. </p> <p> If the pair of equations has more than one solution, return the String &quot;<tt>MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS</tt>&quot;. If the pair of equations has no solutions, return the String &quot;<tt>NO SOLUTIONS</tt>&quot;. </p>",
