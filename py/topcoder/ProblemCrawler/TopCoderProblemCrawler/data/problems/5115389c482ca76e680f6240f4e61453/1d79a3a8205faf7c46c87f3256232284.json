	"statement":"<p> Paco collects penguins. His penguins like to play and run around on the ice where he lives. In order to keep his penguins safe he decided to construct fences to keep danger out. </p> <br /><br /> <p> Paco's penguins have fallen asleep. Acting quickly Paco placed <b>numPosts</b> posts in a circular configuration on the ice. Each post is placed <b>radius</b> meters from location (0,0). The posts are equally spaced with the first post being placed at location (<b>radius</b>, 0). </p> <br /><br /> <p> To construct the fencing, Paco will connect some pairs of fence posts using straight fences. No two segments of the fence are allowed to cross. In the resulting fencing, each fence post will either be unused, or it will be connected to exactly two other fence posts. The fences will create some enclosed areas. In order to avoid wasting resources, Paco requires that each of the enclosed areas has to contain at least one penguin. </p> <br /><br /> <p> Paco's penguins come in many different colors. Penguins of the same color often like to play together. As a result, Paco would like to keep all penguins of the same color in the same enclosure. Two penguins are considered in the same enclosure if they can walk to each other without crossing some fence. </p> <br /><br /> <p> Paco would like to keep all his penguins safe so he would also like to guarantee that each penguin is in some enclosure. </p> <br /><br /> <p> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/FencingPenguins/fencingConcept.png\" /> </p> <br /><br /> <p> You are given two ints <b>numPosts</b> and <b>radius</b>. You are also given two int[]s <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> representing the (<b>x</b>,<b>y</b>) location of each of the sleeping penguins. Each penguin is small enough to be considered a point. You are also given a String <b>color</b>. The i-th character of <b>color</b> is an uppercase or lowercase alphabetic character representing the color of the i-th penguin. Compute and return the number of fencings that Paco can use to keep his penguins safe. If it is not possible to create any enclosure that meets all the requirements return 0. Two fencings are considered different if two posts are connected in one fencing but not in the other. As the number of fencings can be quite large, please return the result modulo 100,007. </p>",
