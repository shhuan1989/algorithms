	"statement":"Your company controls the flow of oil through a network of pipes. The network is composed of N waypoints, each of which has a number between 0 and N-1 inclusive. Some of the waypoints are connected by pipes. You will be given String[]s <b>caps</b> and <b>costs</b> describing these pipes. Each element of <b>caps</b> and <b>costs</b> will be formatted as follows (quotes for clarity):<pre>\n\t&quot;x1,y1 x2,y2 x3,y3 ...&quot;</pre> Each x,y pair is called an indicator. Element i of <b>caps</b> will always contain the same number of indicators as element i of <b>costs</b>. Furthermore, the jth indicator of element i of <b>caps</b> will correspond to the jth indicator of element i of <b>costs</b>. If element i of <b>caps</b> contains the indicator x,y it means there is a pipe that allows y units of flow from waypoint i to waypoint x. The corresponding pair x,z in element i of <b>costs</b> gives the cost z attributed to using this pipe.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> In this network, one waypoint has been designated as the <b>source</b>, and another as the <b>sink</b>. Your business would like to send oil from the <b>source</b> to the <b>sink</b> but it also wants to save money. For this reason, only 1 path will be activated. Your job is to find the path from the <b>source</b> to the <b>sink</b> that maximizes the ratio capacity/cost. For the purposes of this problem, a path will consist of an ordered sequence of distinct waypoints, from the <b>source</b> to the <b>sink</b>, where each consecutive pair of waypoints are connected by a pipe. The pipes on the path must allow oil to flow in the direction of the path (<b>source</b> to <b>sink</b>). No flow of oil may enter the <b>source</b> or leave the <b>sink</b>. The cost of a path is the sum of all the costs of the pipes on the path. The capacity is the minimum capacity over all the pipes on the path. Note that the pipes are directed, so you can push oil from waypoint i to waypoint j only if there is a pipe allowing such a flow <i>in that direction</i>. You will return the maximum value of capacity/cost accurate to 1e-9 absolute or relative. If there is no path of pipes from <b>source</b> to <b>finish</b> to push oil through, return 0.",
