	"statement":"You are playing a solitaire game called Left-Right Digits Game. This game uses a deck of N cards. Each card has a single digit written on it. These digits are given as characters in the String <b>digits</b>. More precisely, the i-th character of <b>digits</b> is the digit written on the i-th card from the top of the deck (both indices are 0-based). <br /><br /><br /><br /> The game is played as follows. First, you place the topmost card (whose digit is the 0-th character of <b>digits</b>) on the table. Then, you pick the cards one-by-one from the top of the deck. For each card, you have to place it either to the left or to the right of all cards that are already on the table. <br /><br /><br /><br /> After all of the cards have been placed on the table, they now form an N-digit number. You are given a String <b>lowerBound</b> that represents an N-digit number. The primary goal of the game is to arrange the cards in such a way that the number X shown on the cards will be greater than or equal to <b>lowerBound</b>. If there are multiple ways to satisfy the primary goal, you want to make the number X as small as possible. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Return the smallest possible value of X you can achieve, as a String containing N digits. If it is impossible to achieve a number which is greater than or equal to <b>lowerBound</b>, return an empty String instead.",
