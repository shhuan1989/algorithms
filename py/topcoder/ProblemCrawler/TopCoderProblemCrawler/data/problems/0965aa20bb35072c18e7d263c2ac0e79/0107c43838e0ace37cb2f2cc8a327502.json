	"statement":"<p>You are given a convex polygon and you must count the number of <b>N</b>-cool points. A point is <b>N</b>-cool if it is a lattice point covered by the polygon and also an endpoint of some <b>N</b>-cool segment. A line segment is <b>N</b>-cool if it contains at least <b>N</b> lattice points that are covered by the polygon. A point is considered covered by the polygon if it is inside or on the boundary of the polygon. Endpoints of a segment are considered to be inside of it. A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates.</p> <p>Consider the example in the picture below. Here <b>N</b> is equal to 6, and there are 21 6-cool points, marked green. Also two 6-cool segments, which are colored red, are shown.</p> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/NCool/ncool.png\" /> <p>You are given int[]s <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> describing the vertices of the polygon (in no particular order). The coordinates of each vertex are specified by corresponding elements of <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>. Return the number of <b>N</b>-cool points.</p> ",
