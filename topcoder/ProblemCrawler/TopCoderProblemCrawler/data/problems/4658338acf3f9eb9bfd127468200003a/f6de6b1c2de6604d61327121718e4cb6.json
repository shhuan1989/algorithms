	"statement":"Josh and Sophie are playing with their new toy. This toy is called Cosmic Blocks. The toy consists of a number of blocks. Each block has the shape of a unit cube. The blocks come in N different colors. The colors are conveniently numbered 0 through N-1. There may be a different number of blocks of different colors.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Sophie likes to build structures. She always takes all the blocks and builds a structure according to the following steps: She places the blocks one at a time, in any order she likes. When placing a block, she may either put it on the floor, or directly on top of a single previously placed block. Hence the final structure can be viewed as a collection of towers, each consisting of one or more blocks placed atop each other. Note that Sophie's structure always contains all the available blocks.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Additionally, Sophie follows one more rule: She always places the blocks in such a way that for each color, all blocks of that color share the same height. Josh likes to take Sophie's structure apart. He also does that in steps. In each step, Josh removes all blocks of a particular color. However, he may only remove a block if no other block is currently placed on top of it.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Given one of Sophie's structures, a permutation of colors is called valid if it represents an order in which Josh can remove the blocks. Sometimes, some permutations of colors are not valid. For example, if Sophie placed a block of color 3 on top of a block of color 0, the permutations where 0 occurs before 3 are not valid.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Sophie and Josh now play the following game: First, Sophie builds a structure according to her rules. Next, Josh counts how many permutations of colors are valid for the structure she built.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Two structures built by Sophie are called <i>fundamentally different</i> if there are colors i and j such that in one structure there is at least one block of color i placed directly on top of a block of color j, and in the other structure there is no such pair of blocks.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given a int[] <b>blockTypes</b>, where the i-th element is the number of blocks of color i Josh and Sophie have. You are also given ints <b>minWays</b> and <b>maxWays</b>. Sophie wants to build a structure such that the result computed by Josh will be between <b>minWays</b> and <b>maxWays</b>, inclusive. Compute and return the number of <i>fundamentally different</i> structures she may build.",
