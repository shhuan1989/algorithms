	"statement":"<p> There are some cats sitting on a straight line that goes from the left to the right. You are given two int[]s <b>position</b> and <b>count</b>. For each valid i, there are <b>count</b>[i] cats initially sitting at the point <b>position</b>[i]. </p> <p> </p> <p> During each minute, each cat chooses and performs one of three possible actions: it may stay in its place, move one unit to the left (i.e., from x to x-1), or move one unit to the right (i.e., from x to x+1). (Note that there are no restrictions. In particular, different cats that are currently at the same point may make different choices.) </p> <p> </p> <p> You are also given an int <b>time</b>. Cats don't like to sit together with other cats, so they want to minimize the number of points that contain two or more cats after <b>time</b> minutes. Return this minimum number. </p>",
