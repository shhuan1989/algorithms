	"statement":"As a serious strategy-games player, you decided to solve one of the most common problems - attacking your opponent's building (barracks), which constantly produces new soldiers.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Before the attack, you've got <b>myUnits</b> soldiers. In a single round, each soldier can either kill one of your opponent's soldiers or inflict 1 hit point of damage to the barracks.<br /><br /> Your opponent doesn't have any soldiers initially. However, his barracks has <b>barHp</b> hit points and produces <b>unitsPerRound</b> soldiers per round.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The course of one round:<br /><br /> 1. Each solider from your army either kills one of your opponent's soldiers or inflicts 1 hit point of damage to the barracks. Each soldier can choose to do something different. When the barracks loses all of its hit points, it is destroyed. <br /><br /> 2. Your opponent attacks. He will kill k of your soldiers, where k is the number of remaining soldiers he has.<br /><br /> 3. If the barracks are not yet destroyed, your opponent will produce <b>unitsPerRound</b> new soldiers.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Your task is to destroy the barracks and kill all your opponent's soldiers. If it is possible, return the minimum number of rounds you need to do this. Otherwise return -1. ",
