	"statement":"Fox Ciel has stumbled upon a new problem: In this problem you will visit some points with integer coordinates in the Cartesian plane. Initially, you are located at the point (0,0). In each step, you can move from your current point to one of the four directly adjacent points. I.e., if you are at (x,y), you can move to one of the points (x,y+1), (x,y-1), (x+1,y), and (x-1,y).<br /><br /> <br /><br /> You are given two int[]s <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>, each containing N elements. Together, <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> describe N distinct points in the Cartesian plane: for 0 &lt;= i &lt; N, point i has the coordinates (<b>x</b>[i],<b>y</b>[i]).<br /><br /> <br /><br /> The goal is to find a sequence of steps that satisfies the following criteria:\n <ul> \n  <li>The starting point is (0,0).</li> \n  <li>The sequence visits each of the N given points at least once.</li> \n  <li>The sequence finishes in one of the given points.</li> \n </ul> Mr. K claims to have solved this problem but Ciel does not believe him. Ciel has prepared a method to verify Mr. K's claims. Given an int <b>wantedParity</b>, the parity of the number of steps in the sequence found by Mr. K, Ciel will find if it is possible to find a sequence that follows the previously mentioned conditions and a new one:<br /><br /> \n <ul>\n  <li>The parity of the total number of steps is <b>wantedParity</b>. In other words, if <b>wantedParity</b>=0 then the total number of steps must be even, and if <b>wantedParity</b>=1 then the total number of steps must be odd.</li> \n </ul> Return &quot;CAN&quot; (quotes for clarity) if at least one such sequence of steps exists, and &quot;CANNOT&quot; otherwise.",
