	"statement":"A certain business maintains a list of all its customers' names. The list is arranged in order of importance, with the last customer in the list being the most important. We want to create a new list sorted alphabetically according to customers' last names, but among customers with the same last name we want the more important ones to appear earlier in the new list. Alphabetical order (and equality of last names) should <b>not</b> be case sensitive. <p> Create a class NameSort that contains a method newList that takes a String[] <b>list</b> of names as input and returns the new sorted list as a String[]. The last name of a customer is defined to be the part of the name following the last space character, or the whole name if it has no space characters. The last name of &quot;Bob E Jones&quot; is &quot;Jones&quot;. The last name of &quot;Madona&quot; is &quot;Madona&quot;. </p><p>The names in the new sorted list should retain the same capitalization as they had in the original list. </p> ",
