Each vertex has a unique label.</li> \n  <li>The graph has no loops (edges connected at both ends to the same vertex) and no more than one edge between any two different vertices.</li> \n  <li>The graph has exactly <b>K</b> bridges (edges whose deletion increases its number of connected components).</li> \n </ul> <p>Find and return the number of these graphs modulo 1,000,000,007.</p>",
