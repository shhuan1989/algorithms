	"statement":"<p> John and Brus are building towers using toy bricks. They have an unlimited supply of bricks of <b>C</b> different colors. Each brick is a 1x1x1 cube. A tower of height X is a 2x2xX rectangular prism, built using 4X bricks. </p> <p> John and Brus want their towers to look nice. A tower is nice if it has the following two properties: </p>\n <ul> \n  <li>There are at most <b>K</b> pairs of neighboring bricks with the same color. (Two bricks are neighboring if they share a common side.)</li> \n  <li>The height of the tower is between 1 and <b>H</b>, inclusive.</li> \n </ul> <p></p> <p> You are given the ints <b>C</b> and <b>K</b> and the long <b>H</b>.
