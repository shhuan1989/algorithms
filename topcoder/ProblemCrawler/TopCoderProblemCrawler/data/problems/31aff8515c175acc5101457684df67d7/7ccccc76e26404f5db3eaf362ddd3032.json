	"statement":"There is a rectangle divided into 1x1 cells. Each cell is either empty or it contains a single coin. <p></p> You can apply the following operation repeatedly. \n <ul> \n  <li>First, choose one of the directions: up, down, left, or right. </li> \n  <li>Then, move all coins in the chosen direction by exactly 1 cell. If this would cause a coin to move out of the rectangle, the coin drops out from the rectangle and disappears. </li> \n </ul> Your objective in this problem is to apply the operations so that the number of coins remaining on the rectangle becomes exactly <b>K</b>. <p></p> You are given the int <b>K</b> and a String[] <b>board</b> that describes the initial state of the rectangle. More precisely, character j of element i of <b>board</b> is 'o' if i-th row of j-th column of the rectangle contains a coin, and it is '.' otherwise. <p></p> Return the minimum number of operations you have to perform. If the objective is impossible, return -1.",
