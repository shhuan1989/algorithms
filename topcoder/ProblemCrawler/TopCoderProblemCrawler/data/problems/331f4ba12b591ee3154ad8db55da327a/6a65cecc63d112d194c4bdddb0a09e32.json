	"statement":"You have been given a <b>rows</b>-by-<b>cols</b> chessboard, with a list of squares cut out. The list of <b>cutouts</b> will be given in a String[] <b>cutouts</b>. Each element of <b>cutouts</b> is a comma-delimited lists of <i>coords</i>. Each coord has the form (quotes for clarity) &quot;r c&quot;. If coord &quot;r c&quot; appears in an element of <b>cutouts</b>, it means that the square at row r column c (0-based) has been removed from the chessboard. This problem will involve placing rooks on a chessboard, so that they cannot attack each other. For a rook to attack a target piece, it must share the same row or column as the target. Your method will return an int that will be the maximum number of rooks that can be placed on the chessboard, such that no pair of rooks can attack each other. Rooks cannot be placed on cut out squares. The cut out squares do not affect where the rooks can attack.",
