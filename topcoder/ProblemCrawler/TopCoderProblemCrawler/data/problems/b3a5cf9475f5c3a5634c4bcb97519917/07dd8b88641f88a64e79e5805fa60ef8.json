B should contain as few elements as possible. The list with the fewest elements is guaranteed to be unique. The elements in your returned list B should be sorted from smallest to largest. </p> <p> A will be given as a int[]. Return B as a int[] also. </p> <p> For example, given the integers { 9, 16, 25 }, the sum of the square roots is 3 + 4 + 5, which is 12. The sum of the square roots of the list { 121, 1 } is also 12, but there is an even shorter list: { 144 }, which is the correct answer. </p> ",
