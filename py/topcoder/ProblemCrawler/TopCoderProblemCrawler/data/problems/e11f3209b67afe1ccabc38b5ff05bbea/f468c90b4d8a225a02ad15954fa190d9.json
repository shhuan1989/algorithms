	"statement":"<p>King Janusz is in great trouble. His enemies have attacked his kingdom from a direction the king did not expect and now he must relocate his troops quickly. The desperate king asked the great sorcerer Mirek for help. </p><p> Mirek has three magic towers that are able to teleport troops. Each time a tower is activated, all soldiers get teleported to new locations. The new location is computed by reflecting the old position through the position of the activated tower. (In other words, the activated tower will be in the middle of each segment that connects the old and the new position of a soldier.) </p><p> The king can activate the towers in any order he likes. Each tower can be activated arbitrarily many times. </p><p> You are given the current locations of the troops in int[]s <b>x1</b> and <b>y1</b>. For each valid i, there is a soldier on the point (<b>x1</b>[i], <b>y1</b>[i]). You are also given the desired locations of the troops in int[]s <b>x2</b> and <b>y2</b>. For each valid i, the King wants to have a soldier on the point (<b>x2</b>[i], <b>y2</b>[i]). Finally, you are given the coordinates of the three towers in int[]s <b>xt</b> and <b>yt</b>. </p><p> The soldiers are not allowed to move in any way other than by teleportation. The order of soldiers does not have to be preserved. (For example, the soldier that started at (<b>x1</b>[0], <b>y1</b>[0]) may end at (<b>x2</b>[2], <b>y2</b>[2]).) </p><p> Return &quot;possible&quot; (quotes for clarity) if it is possible to reach the state in which there are soldiers at all desired locations. Otherwise, return &quot;impossible&quot;. </p>",
