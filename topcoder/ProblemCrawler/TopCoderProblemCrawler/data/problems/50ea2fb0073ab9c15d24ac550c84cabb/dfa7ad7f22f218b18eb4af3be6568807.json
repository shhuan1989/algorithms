	"statement":"The king of Byteland always gets confused when he sees maps of his own kingdom because roads often intersect with each other. So, he issued an order to create a new map. He wants the map to contain two vertical columns, each containing a list of towns. Each town in the kingdom must appear exactly once in the map. Each road in the map must be a straight line segment connecting a town from one column to a town in the other column. No two roads are allowed to intersect each other, except at their endpoints if they share a town. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Your task is to create this new map. You are given an int <b>n</b>, the number of towns in the kingdom (numbered 0 to <b>n</b>-1), and a String[] <b>roads</b>. Concatenate the elements of <b>roads</b> to get a String containing a comma-separated list of roads. Each road is formatted &quot;u v&quot; (quotes for clarity), where u and v are the numbers of the towns connected by that road. Roads are bidirectional, and there are no cycles. If it is impossible to draw the map so that it contains all of the original roads, you can choose to exclude some of the roads. You must exclude the minimum possible number of roads necessary to create a valid map. Return a int[] containing the numbers of the excluded roads (the roads are numbered starting from 0 in the same order as they appear in the concatenated String). If there are multiple solutions, return the one that comes first lexicographically.",
