	"statement":"Your university is holding a programming competition and your team is going to compete. <br /><br /><br /><br /> There are 3*N students in the university. They are numbered from 0 to 3*N-1. Each student has a certain <i>strength</i> which is a positive integer that characterizes his/her programming skills. You are given a int[] <b>strength</b>. The strength of student i is equal to <b>strength</b>[i]. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Your team will consist of students 0, 1 and 2. Other 3*N-3 students will form N-1 more teams so that each team has exactly 3 members. The exact composition of other teams is not known yet. Each team has a strength that is calculated as follows: if it consists of members with strengths X, Y and Z, then the team's strength is equal to max{X, Y, Z} + min{X, Y, Z}. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are interested how your team will rank by strength among the other teams. Formally, the <i>rank</i> of your team is defined as 1 + (the number of other teams that have a strictly greater strength than the strength of your team). <br /><br /><br /><br /> Return the maximum possible rank that your team may have after all students split into teams.",
