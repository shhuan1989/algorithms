	"statement":"<p>Consider a tournament with <b>n</b> participants, numbered 1 to <b>n</b> in decreasing order by strength. The outcome of the tournament is a ranking of all the participants: participant p<sub>1</sub> in first place (ranking 1), participant p<sub>2</sub> in second place (ranking 2), ..., participant p<sub><b>n</b></sub> in last place (ranking <b>n</b>). It can be easily seen that p is a permutation.</p> <p>An outcome of the tournament is called <b>k</b>-fair if every participant gets a ranking that differs from his number by at most <b>k</b>. In other words, p is a permutation where the following condition holds for all i: |i-p<sub>i</sub>|&lt;=<b>k</b>.</p> <p>Given an int <b>n</b> and an int <b>k</b>, return the number of different possible <b>k</b>-fair outcomes for a <b>n</b>-player tournament. The return value must be a String with no extra leading zeroes.</p> ",
