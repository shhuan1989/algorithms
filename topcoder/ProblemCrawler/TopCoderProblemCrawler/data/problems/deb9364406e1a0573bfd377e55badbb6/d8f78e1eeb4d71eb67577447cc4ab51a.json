	"statement":"Magical Girl Iris loves perfect powers. A positive integer n is a perfect power if and only if there are positive integers b &gt; 1 and c &gt; 1 such that b^c = n (where ^ denotes exponentiation). For example, 8 (=2^3) and 243 (=3^5) are perfect powers, while 1 and 54 are not. <br /><br /> One day, Iris discovered that there are very few perfect powers. To avoid being disappointed, she quickly invented the semi-perfect powers: A positive integer n is a semi-perfect power if and only if there are positive integers a &gt;= 1, b &gt; 1, and c &gt; 1 such that a &lt; b and a*(b^c) = n. For example, 243 (=1*3^5) and 54 (=2*3^3) are semi-perfect powers, while 1 and 24 are not. <br /><br /> Note that for some semi-perfect numbers there may be more than one corresponding triple (a,b,c). For example, 432 can be expressed as 2*6^3, but also as 3*12^2. <br /><br /> You are given longs <b>L</b> and <b>R</b>. Calculate and return the number of semi-perfect powers that lie between <b>L</b> and <b>R</b>, inclusive.",
