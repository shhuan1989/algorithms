	"statement":"A popular musical group 'Flattened' has decided to release a new album. It consists of <b>nSongs</b> songs. All songs are of the same <b>length</b> (given in seconds). A CD can store <b>cdCapacity</b> seconds of audio. Each pair of consecutive songs must be separated by a 1 second pause. The group director is superstitious, so the number of songs on a CD must never be divisible by 13. Given these constraints, return the smallest number of CDs required to fit the entire album. ",
