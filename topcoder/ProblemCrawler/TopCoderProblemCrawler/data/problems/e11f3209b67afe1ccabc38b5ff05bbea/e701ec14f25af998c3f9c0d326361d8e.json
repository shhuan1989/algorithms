	"statement":"<p>Janusz owns a hotel. He has already received some reservations for the upcoming year. The days in the year are numbered 1 through 365. For each valid i, there is a guest who will arrive on day <b>arrivals</b>[i] and depart on day <b>departures</b>[i]. </p><p> Janusz can give some guests a special promotion. Any guest that gets the special promotion will leave a good review. Additionally, all guests that meet a guest with promotion will also leave a good review. (Here we assume that two guests meet if and only if they are in the hotel on the same day, including the situation when one of them departs on the same day the other one arrives.) </p><p> Janusz wants to make sure that all his guests leave good reviews. You are given the int[]s <b>arrivals</b> and <b>departures</b>. Return the smallest possible number of special promotions sufficient to make sure that all guests leave good reviews. </p>",
