	"statement":" We want to send a soldier into a mine field with a directional metal detector. The field is an n x n grid, and the soldier will move horizontally (east or west) or vertically (north or south), never leaving the field. His metal detector can be pointed in any of the cardinal directions (east, north, west, or south) and will beep if it senses any mine in that direction, no matter how far away the mine is. Only mines that are exactly in the row or column down which the sensor is pointed are sensed. <p> The soldier can move one square at a time in any of the four directions, pointing his sensor in various directions. But he will not move onto a square if his sensor beeps when pointed in that direction, unless he has previously visited that square. He will continue this process, visiting and revisiting squares as needed, until he is sure that he has visited every square that he can. </p><p> We want to see how well we will be able to do using this type of sensor. Create a class LandMines that contains a method numClear that takes the actual <b>layout</b> of mines in a minefield as input and that returns the number of squares that the soldier can safely visit. </p><p> The <b>layout</b> shows the mine field as a String[], starting with the top row. <tt>'-'</tt> denotes a square with no mine and <tt>'M'</tt> denotes a square that contains a mine. The soldier will always start in the northwest corner (the leftmost square in the top row), which will never contain a mine. </p> ",
