	"statement":"You have one or more sequences of shopping carts. You are given the lengths of these sequences in a int[] <b>a</b>. You are going to remove all the shopping carts.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The process of removing the carts will consist of one or more turns. Each turn will take exactly one minute. At the beginning of each turn, you will have some sequences of carts. For each of those sequences you can choose between two options: \n <ul> \n  <li>split it (in an arbitrary place) into two shorter sequences</li> \n  <li>remove one shopping cart from the sequence</li> \n </ul><br /><br /><br /><br /> There is one additional constraint: during the entire process you can only choose to split a sequence at most <b>b</b> times.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given int[] <b>a</b> and int <b>b</b>. Compute and return the smallest number of minutes in which it is possible to remove all the carts.",
