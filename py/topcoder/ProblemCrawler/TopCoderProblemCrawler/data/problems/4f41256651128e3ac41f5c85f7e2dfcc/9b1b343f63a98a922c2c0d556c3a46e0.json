Cells are numbered 1 through <b>N</b> in the clockwise direction.</p> <p>Initially, you can place a token into any one of these cells.</p> <p>In each turn, you look at the number of the cell containing the token and you calculate s, the sum of the digits in that number. You then move the token s cells clockwise.</p> <p>This process continues until you move the token into a cell that already contained the token before. Your score is the number of cells that were visited by the token at least once during the process (including the initial cell).</p> <p>Given <b>N</b>, return the maximal possible score you can get.</p>",
