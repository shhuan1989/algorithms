	"statement":"<p> In this problem, a left single arrow is defined as a &quot;less than&quot; character ('&lt;') immediately followed by zero or more consecutive hyphen characters ('-'). A left double arrow is a &quot;less than&quot; character ('&lt;') immediately followed by zero or more consecutive equals characters ('='). A right single arrow is zero or more hyphen characters ('-') immediately followed by a &quot;greater than&quot; character ('&gt;'). A right double arrow is zero or more equals characters ('=') immediately followed by a &quot;greater than&quot; character ('&gt;'). For example, the following are arrows (quotes for clarity only): &quot;==&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;-&quot;, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;===&quot;, &quot;---&gt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;. The length of an arrow is the number of characters it contains. </p><p> You will be given a String <b>s</b>. Return the length of the longest arrow in <b>s</b>, or -1 if it does not contain any arrows. </p>",
