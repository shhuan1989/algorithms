	"statement":"Manao is an engineer of a new spaceship. He is responsible for crew safety, particularly during a possible evacuation. The spaceship consists of <b>N</b> units numbered from 0 to <b>N</b>-1. The units are connected by passages, but during evacuation, moving through them is too slow and therefore is prohibited. Some pairs of units are connected by tunnels which contain emergency cabins. There are several emergency cabins at each end of each tunnel. A cabin is designed for a single person and may only be used once for security reasons. A cabin at one end of a tunnel can only be used to reach the other end of that same tunnel. <br /><br /><br /><br /> The tunnel network has a special layout. Consider a sequence of units U<sub>0</sub>, U<sub>1</sub>, ..., U<sub>K</sub> with K &amp;ge 3 and U<sub>0</sub>=U<sub>K</sub>. If all U<sub>0</sub>, U<sub>1</sub>, ..., U<sub>K-1</sub> are pairwise distinct and for each i, 0 &amp;le i &lt; K, U<sub>i</sub> and U<sub>i+1</sub> are connected by a tunnel, this sequence is called a cycle. A cycle is called canonical if U<sub>0</sub> &lt; U<sub>i</sub> for 1 &amp;le i &lt; K and U<sub>1</sub> &lt; U<sub>K-1</sub>. Each unit in the spaceship will be a part of at most one canonical cycle. The tunnel network is given as String[] <b>tunnelNetwork</b>, where each element describes a tunnel and contains four space-separated integers A, B, C, D. This means that there is a tunnel between units A and B and there are C emergency cabins in the tunnel from unit A's side and D emergency cabins from unit B's side. <br /><br /><br /><br /> The crew of the spaceship consists of <b>crewSize</b> members. Each of them might be in any of the <b>N</b> units when the evacuation is announced. Unit 0 is connected to the rescue boat, so every person reaching this unit is considered evacuated. The distribution of emergency cabins within the tunnels is called an evacuation plan. An evacuation plan is called acceptable if there exists a way to evacuate the whole crew for any possible distribution of crew members over the units at the moment when the evacuation is announced. The current evacuation plan might not be acceptable. Manao may demand a number of additional emergency cabins at each end of each tunnel, but he is not allowed to change the location of emergency cabins that are already present in the spaceship. Return the minimum total number of emergency cabins Manao has to add to obtain an acceptable evacuation plan from the current one. If it is impossible, return -1.",
