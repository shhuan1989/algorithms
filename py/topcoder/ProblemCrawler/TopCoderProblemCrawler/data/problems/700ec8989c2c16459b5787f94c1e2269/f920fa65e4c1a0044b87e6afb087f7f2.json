	"statement":"<p> You are working on a large software project and there is a broad assortment of warning or error messages that your users might see in the course of using your product. </p> <p> In order to support localization (translation of these messages into other languages), all of the strings used to create error and warning messages are stored in a resource library. The actual message might be constructed out of more than one resource string. The way this is implemented (for the sake of this problem) is that within a resource string, any instance of &quot;%s&quot; is replaced with another resource string. That other resource string might also have a &quot;%s&quot; in it that is replaced with yet another resource string. For example, if you have resource strings <tt>{&quot;I am %s.&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;a %s coder&quot;, &quot;good&quot;}</tt>, you could replace the <tt>&quot;%s&quot;</tt> in <tt>&quot;I am %s.&quot;</tt> with <tt>&quot;Bob&quot;</tt>, and you'd have the output string <tt>&quot;I am Bob.&quot;</tt>. Alternatively, you could replace the <tt>&quot;%s&quot;</tt> in <tt>&quot;a %s coder&quot;</tt> with <tt>&quot;good&quot;</tt>, and you'd end up with <tt>&quot;a good coder&quot;</tt>. Then you could replace the <tt>&quot;%s&quot;</tt> in <tt>&quot;I am %s.&quot;</tt> with <tt>&quot;a good coder&quot;</tt>, and you'd end up with <tt>&quot;I am a good coder.&quot;</tt> </p> <p> Constructing these strings is the easy part. Often when customers have problems, they only know the last error message they saw. In order to troubleshoot their problems, you need to know what resource was used to construct an error message. Sometimes, there might be more than one possibility. Given a message <b>str</b> and the set of resource strings, <b>resources</b>, return the number of ways <b>str</b> might have been constructed from the elements in <b>resources</b>, modulo 1000000007. If there is more than one element in <b>resources</b> that is the same, each instance should be considered distinct (see example 8 for clarification). </p>",
