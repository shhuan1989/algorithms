	"statement":"Lecette has a clock with an hour hand and a minute hand. The hour hand makes a full rotation in 12 hours, and the minute hand makes a full rotation in one hour. Both hands move smoothly, at constant speeds. The clock has a scale marked in 30 degree increments, and both hands point to the same mark at 00:00. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Lecette wants to know what time it is, but the clock is rotated, so she can't tell where the top of the clock is. She measured the angles of hands from a certain mark, clockwise: <b>hourHand</b> and <b>minuteHand</b> (both in degrees). Return the earliest possible time that is consistent with these measurements. Format the return value as a String of the form &quot;HH:MM&quot; (quotes for clarity). Lecette might have measured the angles incorrectly. If there is no corresponding time, return an empty String instead. ",
