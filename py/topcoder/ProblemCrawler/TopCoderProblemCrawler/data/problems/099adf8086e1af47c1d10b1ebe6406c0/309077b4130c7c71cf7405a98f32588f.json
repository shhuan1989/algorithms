	"statement":"Mrs. Jeipouju is planning to practice orienteering. The area where she'll practice is a rectangular field divided into unit squares. You are given its description as a String[] <b>field</b>. Each character in field is '.' (a period), '*' (an asterisk), or '#' (a number sign). Each '.' represents a passable square without a checkpoint, each '*' represents a passable square with a checkpoint, and each '#' represents an impassable obstacle. It is guaranteed that all passable squares (i.e., all '.'s and '*'s) form a 4-connected tree (see notes for formal definition). The number of checkpoints is at most 300. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> In order to practice, Mrs. Jeipouju chooses <b>K</b> of the checkpoints uniformly at random. Afterwards, she will find the <i>shortest</i> sequence of squares that passes through all chosen checkpoints. The sequence can start at any square, end at any square (possibly other than the starting one), and visit each square any number of times. Each pair of consecutive squares in the sequence must have a common side. The <i>length</i> of the sequence is the number of moves Mrs. Jeipouju will have to make. (So, for example, a sequence that consists of 7 squares has length 6.) <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You are given the String[] <b>field</b> and the int <b>K</b>. Return the expected length of Mrs. Jeipouju's sequence.",
