In each move, you must choose exactly <b>K</b> of the numbers and flip their values (zeros change to ones, and vice-versa). You can choose any <b>K</b> numbers each time, regardless of their current values or whether you have flipped them before. Return the minimal number of moves required to win the game, or -1 if it is impossible. ",
