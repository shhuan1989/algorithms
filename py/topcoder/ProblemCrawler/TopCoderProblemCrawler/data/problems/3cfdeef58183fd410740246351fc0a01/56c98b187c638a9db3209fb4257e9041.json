	"statement":"<p> The purpose of this problem is to evaluate the performance of randomized quick sort in a given instance. Randomized quick sort is an algorithm that takes as input an array of N distinct integers and sorts them in ascending order. We will only consider inputs where all elements to be sorted are different. </p><p> The randomized quick sort we will evaluate works as follows: </p><pre>\nquick-sort(L)\n   if L has less than 2 elements\n      return L\n   otherwise:\n      let P be an element of L chosen at random with uniform distribution\n      let L0 be the list of all elements of L that are strictly less than P, in the same relative order as in L\n      let L1 be the list of all elements of L that are strictly greater than P, in the same relative order as in L\n      let L2 be quick-sort(L0)\n      let L3 be quick-sort(L1)\n      return the concatenation of L2, P and L3, in that order\n</pre><p> We will define the cost of a call to <tt>quick-sort(L)</tt> as its individual cost, plus the cost of each of its recursive calls (if any). The individual cost of a call to <tt>quick-sort(L)</tt> is the number of elements less than <tt>P</tt> that are located to the right of <tt>P</tt> in <tt>L</tt> plus the number of elements greater than <tt>P</tt> that are located to the left of <tt>P</tt> in <tt>L</tt>. </p><p> You will be given a int[] <b>L</b>, which represents the input to be evaluated. Return the expected cost of <tt>quick-sort(<b>L</b>)</tt> when run over that list. </p>",

If the first choice is P=2, however, the cost is two because all other elements are in the wrong position, but after that, the recursive calls are free of charge because both lists have one element.
