	"statement":"The final round of Top Cat Open 2014 is over! However, we do not know the final standings yet because the scoreboard has been frozen for the last hour. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> There are <b>N</b> contestants in the final round. They are numbered 0 through <b>N</b>-1 according to the results of the previous round. According to the frozen standings, contestant i has already solved X[i] problems. After the standings have been frozen, each contestant was only allowed to solve one additional problem. Thus, for each i the actual number of problems solved by contestant i is either X[i] or X[i] + 1. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> In the final standings the contestants will be ordered by the number of problems solved (more is better). In case of a tie the contestant with a smaller number will have the better place. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> The array X is generated from given ints <b>A</b> and <b>seed</b>. Use the following pseudocode to generate X: <pre>\n64bit_integer x = <b>seed</b>;\nfor (i = 0; i &lt; <b>N</b>; i++) {\n    x = x * 20142014 % 1000000007;\n    X[i] = x % <b>A</b>;\n}\n</pre> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> How many different rankings are possible at the end of the contest? Return this value modulo 1,000,000,007. ",
