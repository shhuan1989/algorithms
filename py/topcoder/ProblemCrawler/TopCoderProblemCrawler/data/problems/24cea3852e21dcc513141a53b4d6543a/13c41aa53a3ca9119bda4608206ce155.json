	"statement":"Fox Ciel has a family crest. The crest is a simple line drawing that consists of several line segments. You are given the description of the crest as four equally long int[]s: <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and <b>D</b>. For each valid i, the crest contains a line segment that connects the points (<b>A</b>[i], <b>B</b>[i]) and (<b>C</b>[i], <b>D</b>[i]). Note that some of the given line segments may intersect and even overlap each other.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Fox Ciel got a large square piece of paper with side length 1,000,000,000. She is now going to draw some copies of her family crest onto the paper. All copies must have the same size as the original described by <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, and <b>D</b>. Also, all copies must have the same orientation. In other words, once she draws the first copy, all other copies must be obtained by translation only (without any rotation or resizing). Additionally, the copies must be pairwise disjoint. (I.e., they are not allowed to share any points at all.)<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Return &quot;Infinite&quot; (quotes for clarity) if it is possible to draw an infinite number of non-overlapping copies of the family crest onto the paper. Otherwise, return &quot;Finite&quot;.",
