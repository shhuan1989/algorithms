	"statement":"<p> You are given an int <b>W</b>. There is a rectangle in the XY-plane with corners at (0, 0), (0, 1), (<b>W</b>, 0), and (<b>W</b>, 1). Let T[x] be the triangle with vertices at (0, 1), (<b>W</b>, 1) and (x, 0). (All points that lie inside the triangle are a part of T[x] as well.) </p> <p> The objective in this problem is to calculate the area of the region (T[0] xor T[1] xor ... xor T[<b>W</b>]). (See Notes for a formal definition.) The figures below show the region (T[0] xor T[1] xor ... xor T[<b>W</b>]) for <b>W</b>=1,2,3,4,5,6. </p> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/TriangleXor/TriangleXor1.png\" /> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/TriangleXor/TriangleXor2.png\" /> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/TriangleXor/TriangleXor3.png\" /> <br /><br /> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/TriangleXor/TriangleXor4.png\" /> <br /><br /> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/TriangleXor/TriangleXor5.png\" /> <br /><br /> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/TriangleXor/TriangleXor6.png\" /> <p> Return the integer part of the area of the region. </p> ",
