	"statement":"Manao has invented a new unusual two-player game which he calls the String Game. The game is played on a set of strings of the same length comprised of lowercase English letters. <br /><br /><br /><br /> In the beginning, the first player chooses a string X from the set and permutes its characters in any way he wants. He also chooses a permutation of the English alphabet. After that, the second player may permute the characters in each of the strings in the set, except for X. Now X is lexicographically compared to each of the other strings in the set using the permuted English alphabet. If X is strictly smaller than each of the other strings, the first player wins. Otherwise, the second player does. <br /><br /><br /><br /> In order to compare two different strings <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, first it is necessary to find the first position at which these strings differ. Let the characters at this position in <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> be <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. If <i>a</i> stands earlier than <i>b</i> in the permuted alphabet, then <i>A</i> is lexicographically smaller than <i>B</i>, otherwise <i>B</i> is lexicographically smaller than <i>A</i>. For example, with alphabet {b, a, c, d, ..., z}, the string &quot;aba&quot; is lexicographically smaller than the string &quot;aab&quot; because 'b' stands earlier than 'a' in the alphabet. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given a String[] <b>S</b>, the set of strings on which the String Game is played. Determine all strings which, when chosen by the first player, allow him to win if both he and his opponent play optimally. That is, the first player always permutes the string X and the alphabet optimally, and then the second player permutes all the other strings optimally. Return a int[] containing the sorted list of all 0-based indices of all such strings.",
