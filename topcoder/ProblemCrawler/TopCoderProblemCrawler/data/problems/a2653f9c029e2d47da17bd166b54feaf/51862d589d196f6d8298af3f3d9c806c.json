	"statement":"You are given a String containing a list of words separated by single spaces, with no leading or trailing spaces. You have a panel on which you would like to write these words, in order, possibly over multiple lines. The words must go from left to right within each line, and the lines must go from top to bottom. Each line must contain only complete words, and each pair of adjacent words in a line must be separated by a single space. There must be no leading or trailing spaces. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You must write the words in a font size greater than 7. In a font of size N, the height of each letter is 2*N pixels, and the width of each character (letters and spaces) is N+2 pixels. There is no space between adjacent characters and adjacent lines. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given a String <b>text</b> containing the words you must write. The dimensions of the panel in pixels are given in the ints <b>width</b> and <b>height</b>. You are not allowed to rotate the panel. Return the largest integer font size strictly greater than 7 that you can use to write the words on the panel, or -1 if it is impossible.",
