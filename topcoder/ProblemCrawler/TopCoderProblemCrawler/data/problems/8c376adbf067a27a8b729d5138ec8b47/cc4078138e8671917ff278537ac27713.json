Each term will be either an integer between 0 and 1000, inclusive, or a sequence of lowercase letters, representing a variable. The values of all the variables in <b>eq</b> will be given in a String[], <b>vars</b>, each element of which will be formatted as &quot;VARIABLE VALUE&quot;. You should return the sum represented by <b>eq</b>.",
