	"statement":"You have two lists of numbers, X and Y, each containing exactly <b>N</b> elements. You can optionally apply any number of circular shifts to each list. A circular shift means removing the last element from a list and re-inserting it before the first element. For example, {1, 2, 3} would become {3, 1, 2}, and {3, 1, 2} would become {2, 3, 1}. After you apply any circular shifts, the final score is calculated as:<br /><br /> X[0]*Y[0] + X[1]*Y[1] + ... + X[<b>N</b>-1]*Y[<b>N</b>-1]<br /><br /> You are given ints <b>Z0</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>M</b>. Generate a list Z of length 2*<b>N</b>, using the following recursive definition:<br /><br /> Z[0] = <b>Z0</b> MOD <b>M</b> <br /><br /> Z[i] = (Z[i-1]*<b>A</b>+<b>B</b>) MOD <b>M</b> (note that Z[i-1]*<b>A</b>+<b>B</b> may overflow a 32-bit integer) <br /><br /> Then, generate lists X and Y, each of length <b>N</b>, using the following definitions:<br /><br /> X[i] = Z[i] MOD 100 <br /><br /> Y[i] = Z[i+<b>N</b>] MOD 100 <br /><br /> Return the maximal final score you can achieve.
