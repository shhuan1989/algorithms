	"statement":"Suffix number i of a string S is the suffix that starts with the character S[i]. For example, for S=&quot;abcde&quot; suffix 0 is &quot;abcde&quot; and suffix 3 is &quot;de&quot;. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> The suffix array of a string S is defined as the permutation of suffix numbers that corresponds to their lexicographic order. For example, suppose that S=&quot;abca&quot;. If we order all suffixes of S lexicographically, we get the following: &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;abca&quot; &lt; &quot;bca&quot; &lt; &quot;ca&quot;. The corresponding suffix numbers are 3, 0, 1, and 2, in this order. Thus, for this string S the suffix array would be {3, 0, 1, 2}. Note that the length of a suffix array is the same as the length of the original string. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You are given a int[] <b>SA</b>: the suffix array of an unknown string. Return the smallest possible number of <i>different</i> characters in that string.",
