	"statement":"Young Andrew has just learned about quadratic equations. He was quite amazed by the fact that their solutions could look like (5+sqrt(3))/4, so he wants to dig into this issue. More specifically, given five numbers <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>z</b> and <b>k</b>, he wants to find the number of equations a*t<sup>2</sup>+b*t+c=0 such that (<b>x</b>+<b>y</b>*sqrt(<b>d</b>))/<b>z</b> is a solution of the equation (i.e., when substituting it for t the equation holds) and a, b and c are integers, -<b>k</b> &lt;= a, b, c &lt;= <b>k</b>. Notice that the equations he's looking for are not necessarily quadratic, i.e., a is allowed to be zero, as is b and/or c.",
