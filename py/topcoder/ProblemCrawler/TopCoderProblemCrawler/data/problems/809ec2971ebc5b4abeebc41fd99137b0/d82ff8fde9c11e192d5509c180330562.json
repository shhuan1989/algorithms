	"statement":"An undirected graph is said to be a <i>wheel</i> if there exists a &quot;center&quot; vertex which is adjacent to all other vertices in the graph, and the subgraph induced by taking all other vertices of the graph is precisely a cycle. Additionally, any wheel must have at least 3 vertices in the cycle surrounding the center vertex. The <i>span</i> of a wheel is the degree of the center vertex. For example, the graph below is a wheel with span 4 (the center vertex is colored black).<br /><br /><br /><br /> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/FractalWheels/graph3.gif\" /><br /><br /><br /><br /> We define a <i>fractal wheel</i> with depth d and span h as follows: a fractal wheel with depth 0 and span h is simply a wheel with span h.<br /><br /><br /><br /> To obtain a fractal wheel with depth d &gt; 0 and span h, we first take a fractal wheel with depth d-1 and span h. Let V be the set of all vertices at distance d from the center vertex of this fractal wheel. For each vertex u in V, add to the graph a new wheel with span h such that its center vertex is u. Each added wheel must be vertex-disjoint from the other added wheels. The resulting graph is a fractal wheel with depth d and span h, and the center vertex of the resulting fractal wheel is the same as the center vertex of the initial fractal wheel with depth d-1.<br /><br /><br /><br /> For example, the graph below is a fractal wheel with depth 1 and span 4 (note that adding or removing any edges from this graph would result in a graph which is not a fractal wheel):<br /><br /><br /><br /> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/FractalWheels/graph4.gif\" /><br /><br /><br /><br /> Given a graph G with <b>N</b> vertices numbered 0 to <b>N</b>-1, inclusive, you must determine if G is a fractal wheel. Concatenate the elements of <b>edges</b> to get a String containing a comma-separated list of edges describing G. Each edge is formatted (quotes for clarity) &quot;u v&quot;, which denotes that there is an edge between vertices u and v in G.<br /><br /><br /><br /> If G is not a fractal wheel, then return an empty int[]. Otherwise, return a int[] with two elements: the depth and span of the fractal wheel, respectively.",
