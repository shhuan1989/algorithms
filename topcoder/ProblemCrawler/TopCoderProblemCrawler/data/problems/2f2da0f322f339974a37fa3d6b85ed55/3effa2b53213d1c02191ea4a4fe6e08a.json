	"statement":"<p><i>The problem statement contains an image.</i></p> <p> Consider an empty chess board (8x8 squares), with a chess knight placed on one of the squares. The possible movements of a chess knight are marked on the picture below. </p> <br /><br /> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/ChessKnight/ChessKnightMoves.gif\" /> <p> If the knight moves <i>n</i> times, each time picking one of the eight directions uniformly at random (possibly a direction which makes the knight leave the chess board), determine the probability that it's still on the board after <i>n</i> jumps. Once the knight leaves the board, it can't enter it again. </p> <p> Create a class ChessKnight containing the method probability which takes an int <b>x</b>, an int <b>y</b> (the start square of the chess knight, where 1,1 is one of the corners) and an int <b>n</b>, the number of jumps the knight will make. The method should return a double, the probability that the knight is still on the chess board after making <i>n</i> random jumps. </p> ",
