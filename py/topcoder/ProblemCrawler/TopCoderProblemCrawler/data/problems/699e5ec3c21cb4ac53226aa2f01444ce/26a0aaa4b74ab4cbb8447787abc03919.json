	"statement":"In Digraph Country, there are N cities indexed 0 through N-1. Each pair of different cities is connected by two one-way roads, one in each direction. The lengths of roads may be asynmetric. I.e., it is possible that the road from i to j and the road from j to i have different lengths. <p></p> A travelling salesman wants to visit each city of the country in order to sell the products of his company. To travel as quickly as possible, he plans the following strategy. \n <ul> \n  <li>First, he visits city 0.</li> \n  <li> In each of the next steps, he travels to one of the cities he has not visited yet. When taking the decision which city to visit next, the salesman looks at roads from his current city into all unvisited cities, and picks the shortest of these roads. If there are multiple shortest roads, the salesman picks the one of them that leads into the city with the smallest index.</li> \n  <li>He terminates the travel when he has visited all the cities. Note that he does not have to go back to city 0. </li> \n </ul> <p></p> The salesman was just about to leave for his journey when he heard a rumor. According to the rumor, one of the roads is just going to be reconstructed. The reconstruction will be done instantly, before the salesman starts to travel. Still, there are two problems. First, the salesman has no idea which one of the roads is the one that's going to be reconstructed. Second, after the reconstruction the new length of the road can be an arbitrary integer between 1 and 9999, inclusive. The salesman is worried how will this change influence his travels in the worst case. <p></p> You are given the length of the roads in four separate String[]s. <b>thousands</b> gives the digit in the thousands place of the length of each road, <b>hundreds</b> gives the digit in the hundreds place, <b>tens</b> gives the digit in the tens place, and <b>ones</b> gives the digit in the ones place. In each of these String[]s, the j-th character of the i-th element represents the length of the road from city i to city j. So, for example, if <b>thousands</b>[3][5]='1', <b>hundreds</b>[3][5]='0', <b>tens</b>[3][5]='4', and <b>ones</b>[3][5]='7', the road from city 3 to city 5 has length 1047. <p></p> Return the distance the salesman will travel in the worst possible case, given that the length of any single road may change.
