	"statement":"<p> Bob is going to create a graph with <b>N</b> nodes. The graph will be constructed in two steps. First, Bob will take <b>N</b> isolated vertices, label them 1 through <b>N</b> and color each of them using one of <b>K</b> colors. Then, Bob will add some directed edges to the graph. For each i between 2 and <b>N</b>, inclusive, Bob may choose a single value j &lt; i such that the nodes i and j have different colors. If he does, he will add the edge from i to j to his graph. Note that Bob may choose not to add any edge from node i, even if there are some valid choices of j. </p> <p> Two graphs are considered the same if they have the same node colors and the same set of edges. </p> <p> You are given the longs <b>N</b> and <b>K</b>. You are also given an int <b>M</b>. Compute and return the number of different graphs Bob may construct, modulo <b>M</b>. </p>",
