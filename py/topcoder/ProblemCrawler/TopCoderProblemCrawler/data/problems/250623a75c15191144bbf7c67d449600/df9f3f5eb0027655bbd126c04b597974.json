	"statement":"We all know that a planar graph is one that you can draw without having any edges crossing. Perhaps less well known is that a planar graph can always be drawn with vertices on lattice points and with edges as straight lines between connected vertices.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You will be given a String[], <b>graph</b>, representing a planar undirected graph, where the j<sup>th</sup> character of element i of <b>graph</b> indicates whether vertices i and j are connected ('T' for true, 'F' for false). Your task is to find the area of the smallest rectangular box that the vertices can be placed in so that they are located on lattice points with non-overlapping straight edges between connected vertices.",
