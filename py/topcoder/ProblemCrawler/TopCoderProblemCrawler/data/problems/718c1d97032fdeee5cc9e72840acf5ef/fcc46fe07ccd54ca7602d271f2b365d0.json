	"statement":"For a given string S of length n an inversion is a pair of integers (i, j) such that 0 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt;= n-1 and S[i] &gt; S[j]. (That is, the character at 0-based index i is greater than the character at 0-based index j.) For example, the string &quot;abcab&quot; has 3 inversions: (1, 3), (2, 3), and (2, 4). <p></p> Given are ints <b>n</b> and <b>minInv</b>, and a String <b>minStr</b>. We will consider all strings that are permutations of the first <b>n</b> lowercase English letters. That is, these strings have length <b>n</b> and contain each of the first <b>n</b> letters exactly once. Out of these strings, return the lexicographically smallest string R with the following two properties: \n <ul> \n  <li>The number of inversions in R is at least <b>minInv</b>.</li> \n  <li>The string R is not lexicographically smaller than <b>minStr</b>.</li> \n </ul> If there is no such string, return an empty String instead.
