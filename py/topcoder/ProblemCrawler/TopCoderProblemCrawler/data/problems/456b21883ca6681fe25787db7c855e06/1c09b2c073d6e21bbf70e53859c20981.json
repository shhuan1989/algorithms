	"statement":"We're going to play a very simple game of poker. As in regular poker, there is a <i>pot</i>, and the winner of the hand wins the money in the pot. In this game, each of two players will be given a single card, numbered between 0 and <tt>N-1</tt>, inclusive. The pot initially contains $1, and the size of each bet is also $1. The player who goes first may either check (put nothing in the pot) or bet (put $1 in the pot). If the first player checked, the second player may either check or bet. If he bets the first player must then either fold (concede the pot to the second player) or call (put $1 in). If, on the other hand, the first player bets, the second player must decide whether to fold or call. If one player folds, then the other player wins the pot automatically. If neither player folds, then the player with the higher card wins the pot (ties split the pot). Thus, there will only be five possible outcomes to the betting: \n <ul> \n  <li>Player 1 bets, player 2 folds; player 1 wins the pot</li> \n  <li>Player 1 bets, player 2 calls; the player with the higher card wins, a tie results in the pot being evenly divided</li> \n  <li>Player 1 checks, player 2 checks; the player with the higher card wins, a tie results in the pot being evenly divided</li> \n  <li>Player 1 checks, player 2 bets, player 1 folds; player 2 wins the pot</li> \n  <li>Player 1 checks, player 2 bets, player 1 calls; the player with the higher card wins, a tie results in the pot being evenly divided</li> \n </ul> You will be given a complete description of a probabilistic strategy played by player 1. You, as player two, want to maximize your expected value, and must play accordingly, given player one's strategy. <br /><br /><br /><br /> A double[] <b>betProb</b> gives the probability that player one will bet with each of the <tt>N</tt> cards. <b>betProb[i]</b> gives the probability that player one will bet given that his card is <tt>i</tt>. Similarly, <b>callProb[i]</b> gives the probability that player one will first check, and then call if you bet, given that his card is <tt>i</tt>. Therefore, <tt>1-<b>betProb[i]</b>-<b>callProb[i]</b></tt> gives the probability that player one will check and then fold to your bet.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You should return your expected profit (including the initial $1 in the pot) given that you play optimally (knowing player one's strategy), and that each player's card is assigned independently and uniformly at random.",
