	"statement":"<p><i>Warning: This problem statement contains superscripts and/or subscripts. It may not display properly outside of the applet.</i></p> <br /><br /> <p> Tomek and Wojtek are testing their new revolutionary BitX network transmission technology. It is based on a system of incredibly precise clocks. The transmission protocol uses a single cable and just two different voltages, called high and low. During the transmission of a sequence of bits the signal is high while '1' bits are being transmitted and low while '0' bits are being transmitted. Therefore, during the transmission of a sequence of bits b<sub>0</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, ..., b<sub>m - 1</sub> the number of signal changes is equal to the number of indices i between 0 and m - 2, inclusive, such that b<sub>i</sub> is different from b<sub>i + 1</sub>. </p> <p> Tomek is going to transmit <b>n</b> elements of the arithmetic sequence <b>a</b> * x + <b>b</b> to Wojtek using BitX. He will transmit the binary representations of numbers <b>a</b> * 1 + <b>b</b>, <b>a</b> * 2 + <b>b</b>, ..., <b>a</b> * n + <b>b</b> sequentially, without any breaks or delimiters between consecutive numbers. For example, if <b>a</b> = 3, <b>b</b> = 5, <b>n</b> = 4, the sequence of bits he will transmit will be 10001011111010001. The number of signal changes will therefore be equal to 8. </p> <p> You are given longs <b>a</b>, <b>b</b> and <b>n</b>. Return the total number of signal changes during Tomek's transmission. </p>",
