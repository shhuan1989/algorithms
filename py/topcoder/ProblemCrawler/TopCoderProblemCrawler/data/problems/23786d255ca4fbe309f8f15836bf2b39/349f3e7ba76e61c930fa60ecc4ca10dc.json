	"statement":"Most large software packages have some logging options built in to them. Many times there are different logging levels that can be set. Your task is to write a class to perform this logging. Your class will be given a number of messages, each associated with some priority. If the priority of a message is equal to or higher than the logging priority, then you should log that message, otherwise it should be ignored. You will be given a String[], <b>messages</b>, each of whose elements represents a single message, a String[], <b>priorities</b>, each of whose elements represents the priority of the message with the same index, and a String[], <b>precedence</b>, giving the order of the priorities. Element 0 of <b>precedence</b> represents the lowest priority, element 1 the next lowest, and so on. Lastly, you will be given a String, <b>loggingPriority</b>, representing the lowest priority of messages to log. <b>loggingPriority</b> and each element of <b>priorities</b> will be formatted as &quot;&lt;priority&gt;&quot;, or &quot;&lt;priority&gt; &lt;num&gt;&quot;, where &lt;priority&gt; is an element of <b>precedence</b> and &lt;num&gt; is an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive. If &lt;num&gt; is not present, it is the same as if it were a 0. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You should return a String[] containing all of the messages with sufficiently high priority to be logged, in the order they were given to you. A message has sufficiently high priority to be logged if the corresponding &lt;priority&gt; is higher than that in <b>loggingPriority</b>, or if the corresponding &lt;priority&gt; is the same, and &lt;num&gt; is greater than or equal to that in <b>loggingPriority</b>. Additionally, priorities are case insensitive. <br /><br /><br /><br /> So, if <b>precedence</b> is {&quot;info&quot;,&quot;DEBUG&quot;,&quot;error&quot;,&quot;fatal&quot;}, and <b>loggingPriority</b> is &quot;debug 1&quot;, then messages with priorities of &quot;debug 1&quot;, &quot;debug 43&quot;, &quot;Error&quot;, and &quot;fatal 1&quot; would all be logged. Messages with priorities of &quot;debug 0&quot;, &quot;debug&quot;, &quot;info&quot;, and &quot;info 100&quot; would not be logged.",
