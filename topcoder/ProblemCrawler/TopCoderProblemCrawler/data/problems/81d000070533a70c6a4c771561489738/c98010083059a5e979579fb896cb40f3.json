	"statement":"Alice and Bob live in a country that consists of N islands. The islands are numbered 0 through N-1. Several pairs of islands are connected by bridges. Some of the bridges are very old. They will collapse after the second passage. The other bridges are new and never collapse. Only one person can cross a bridge at a time. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given a String[] <b>bridges</b>. Character j of element i of <b>bridges</b> is 'O' (uppercase letter o) if the island i and the island j are connected by an old bridge; 'N' if they are connected by a new bridge; and 'X' if they are not connected by a bridge. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Alice wants to make <b>an</b> round trips between the islands <b>a1</b> and <b>a2</b>. That is, she wants to make <b>an</b> consecutive trips, where each trip starts at <b>a1</b>, gets somehow to <b>a2</b>, and after some more steps ends back at <b>a1</b>. At the same time, Bob wants to make <b>bn</b> round trips between the islands <b>b1</b> and <b>b2</b>. Each round trip may use any sequence of consecutive bridges. Different round trips may, but don't have to, use the same sequence of bridges. Of course, each old bridge may only be used at most twice. (I.e., it may be used twice by Alice, or twice by Bob, or once by each of them, or just once, or not at all.) <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given the String[] <b>bridges</b> and the ints <b>a1</b>, <b>a2</b>, <b>an</b>, <b>b1</b>, <b>b2</b>, and <b>bn</b>. If it is possible to plan all the round trips for Alice and Bob, return &quot;Yes&quot;, otherwise return &quot;No&quot;.",
