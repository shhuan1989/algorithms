In his memory, Herb has a program. The program is a sequence of commands. For each i, the i-th of these commands has the following form:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>First move forward <b>a</b>[i] tiles.</li> \n  <li>Then turn 90 degrees to the right, <b>a</b>[i] times in a row.</li> \n </ul> <p>Herb has decided to run the program <b>T</b> times. You are given the int <b>T</b> and the int[] <b>a</b> that describes Herb's program. Let A be the initial position of Herb and B be his position after the program was executed <b>T</b> times.
