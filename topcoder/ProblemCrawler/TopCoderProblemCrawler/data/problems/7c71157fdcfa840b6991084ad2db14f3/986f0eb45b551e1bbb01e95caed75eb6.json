	"statement":"<p>Cat Snuke and wolf Sothe are playing the Path Game.</p> <br /><br /> <p>The Path Game is played on a rectangular grid of square cells. The grid has 2 rows and some positive number of columns. Each cell is either black or white.</p> <br /><br /> <p>A left-to-right path in the grid is a sequence of white cells such that the first cell in the sequence is in the leftmost column, the last cell in the sequence is in the rightmost column, and each pair of consecutive cells shares a common side.</p> <br /><br /> <p>The initial coloring of the grid is such that there is at least one left-to-right path. You are given this initial coloring as a String[] <b>board</b> with two elements. For each i and j, <b>board</b>[i][j] is either '#' (representing a black cell) or '.' (representing a white cell).</p> <br /><br /> <p>The players take alternating turns. In each turn, the current player has to choose and color one white cell black. Snuke goes first. The game ends when there is no longer a left-to-right path on the board. The last player who colored a cell loses the game. In other words, the loser is the player who was forced to block the last left-to-right path.</p> <br /><br /> <p>Assume that both players play the game optimally. Return &quot;Snuke&quot; (quotes for clarity) if Snuke wins the game, and &quot;Sothe&quot; otherwise.</p>",
