	"statement":"<p>The &quot;Tips&quot; game is played by a single player in a room full of stuff. Before the game, the game master has hidden N clues somewhere in the room. The clues are numbered 0 through N-1. Your task is to find as many of these clues as possible. </p> <p> The probability that you'll find clue i without any information is <b>probability</b>[i] percent. Each clue you'll find will tell you the locations of some clues. If you already know the location of a clue you are certain to find it. </p> <p> You are given a String[] <b>clues</b> with the information on the content of the clues. For each valid i and j, <b>clues</b>[i][j] will be either 'Y' or 'N'. Here, 'Y' means that clue i contains the location of clue j, and 'N' means that it does not. You are also given the int[] <b>probability</b>. </p> <p> Compute and return the expected number of clues you will find during the game. </p>",
