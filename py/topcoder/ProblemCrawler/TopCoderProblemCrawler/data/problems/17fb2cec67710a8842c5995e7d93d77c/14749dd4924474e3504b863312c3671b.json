	"statement":"Antichess, also called Suicide Chess, is a chess variant in which the objective is to lose all of your pieces. The rules of the game are the same as those of chess, except that capturing is compulsory. In other words, when a player has the opportunity to capture an opponent's piece, he must do it. If the player has multiple choices for capturing during a single turn, he may choose any single one. The king plays no special role in the game; it can be captured like any other piece. Because of the forced capture rule, antichess games often have a long sequence of forced captures by one player. <br /><br /><br /><br /> In this problem, we are given an end-game position - specifically, the case when a player has only pawns left and the other has a queen. Considering we are the white player controlling the pawns and we always make the first move, we are interested in how many consecutive pawns we can force our opponent to capture. The game ends when either the queen has been captured, the queen can no longer capture, there are no pawns left, or there is a stalemate. A stalemate is produced if, on white's turn, there are no valid pawn moves. <br /><br /><br /><br /> The queen may move in any straight line, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The queen may not jump over other pieces. In other words, all squares between the square where the queen starts her move and where the queen ends her move must be empty. When the square where the queen ends her move contains a pawn of the opponent, then this piece is captured. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> A pawn can only move one row straight forward, to a higher row (rows are numbered from 1 to 8 and columns from 'a' to 'h'). Pawns on row 2 can also move 2 rows straight forward. Pawns on row 8 can no longer move. As in the case of the queen, the pawn is not allowed to jump over other pieces. When capturing, the pawn goes one square diagonally forward onto the opponent's captured piece. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given a String[] <b> white</b>, where each element contains 2 characters describing the position of a pawn: the first character is a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'h', and the second character is a digit between '2' and '7'. You are also given a String <b> black </b> that contains 2 characters describing the position of the queen: the first character is a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'h', and the second character is a digit between '1' and '8'. Return the highest number of pawns you can force your opponent to capture, considering their play is optimal. ",

			"note":"One possibility is to move the pawn from a2 to a4. The black is forced to take the pawn on e3, but then the white is forced to take the queen on e3 with the pawn on d2. In this case, there is only one pawn sacrificed.  A better play is the following:  1. Move the pawn from d2 to d3. Queen captures the pawn on e3.  2. Move the pawn from c2 to c3. Queen captures the pawn on d3.  3. Move the pawn from a2 to a3. Queen captures the pawn on c3.  4. Move the pawn from h4 to h5. Queen captures the pawn on a3.  5. Move the pawn from h5 to h6. The black queen cannot capture this pawn.  Thus, we were able to sacrifice 4 pawns.  But there is an even better alternative: 1. Move the pawn from d2 to d3. Queen captures the pawn on e3.  2. Move the pawn from d3 to d4. Queen captures the pawn on d4.  3. Move the pawn from a2 to a3. Queen captures the pawn on h4.  4. Move the pawn from a3 to a4. Queen captures the pawn on a4.  5. Move the pawn from c2 to c4. Queen captures the pawn on c4.  Now we managed to give away all the pawns, so the correct answer for this example is 5. ",
