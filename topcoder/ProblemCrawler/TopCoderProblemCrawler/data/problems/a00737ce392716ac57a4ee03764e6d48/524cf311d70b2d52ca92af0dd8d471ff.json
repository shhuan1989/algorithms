	"statement":"<p>You are a student advisor at TopCoder University (TCU). The graduation requirements at TCU are somewhat complicated. Each requirement states that a student must take some number of classes from some set, and all requirements must be satisfied for a student to graduate. Each class is represented as a single distinct character. For example, one requirement might be &quot;Take any 2 classes of B, C, D, or F.&quot; Further complicating the matter is the fact that no class can be used to satisfy more than one requirement. And so students come to you all the time, dazed and confused, because they don't know how close they are to satisfying the requirements so that they can graduate!</p> <p>Each class is represented as a distinct single character whose ASCII value is between 33 and 126, inclusive, but is also not a numeric character ('0'-'9'). You will be given a String <b>classesTaken</b>, which represents the classes that a given student has taken. You will also be given a String[] <b>requirements</b>, which lists the requirements needed to graduate. Each String in <b>requirements</b> will start with a positive integer, followed by some number of classes. For example, the requirement &quot;Take any 2 classes from B, C, D, or F&quot; would be represented in <b>requirements</b> as &quot;2BCDF&quot;.</p> <p>Your method should return a String representing the classes that the student needs to take in order to graduate, in ASCII order. Classes may not be taken more than once. If there is more than one set that will allow the student to graduate, return the smallest set. If there are multiple smallest sets, return the lexicographically smallest of these. Finally, if there is no set that will enable this student to graduate, return &quot;0&quot;.</p> ",
