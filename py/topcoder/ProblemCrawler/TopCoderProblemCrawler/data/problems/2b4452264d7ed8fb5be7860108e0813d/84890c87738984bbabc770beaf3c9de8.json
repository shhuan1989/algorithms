	"statement":"<p>A robot is placed randomly on a cell in a <b>N</b>x<b>N</b> square grid. The robot has a <b>program</b> consisting of several commands, where each command is either 'U' (move up), 'D' (move down), 'L' (move left), or 'R' (move right). The commands are executed in order, and the <b>program</b> is cyclical (i.e., after the last command is executed, it will start over from the first command). The robot stops moving only if it has left the grid or if it has executed 50,000 commands.</p> <p>You will be given an int <b>N</b> and a String <b>program</b>. Return the expected number of commands that will be executed before the robot stops. You can assume that all the cells in the grid are equally likely to be the starting cell.</p>",
