	"statement":"Given a closed path in the plane (which may intersect itself or even retrace itself), each point that is not on the path has a unique &quot;winding number&quot; that tells how many times the path winds around that point. As the path is traced out, the direction from the point to the path changes continuously and after the path has been completed the total change is an integral number of complete rotations. A negative result indicates that the path wound around the point in a clockwise direction. <p> For example in the following diagram where paths are straight line segments from number to number, </p>\n <ul>\n  <li> For the path 13421 the winding number of P is 1</li>\n  <li> For the path 13421231 the winding number of P is 0 (+1 + -1 = 0)</li>\n  <li> For the path 124312431 the winding number of P is -2</li>\n  <li> For the path 421234 the winding number of P is 0</li>\n </ul> <p></p> <pre>        1               2\n                  P\n                  3      4\n</pre><p> We are interested in the winding numbers for the points along the x axis. We are given the vertices of a piecewise linear closed path in the order in which the path is traced (the final segment is the one from the last given vertex to the first given vertex). Create a class AllWoundUp that contains a method maxWind that is given the vertices in int[]s <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> and that returns the largest non-negative winding number among all the points on the x axis (that are not on the path). </p> ",
