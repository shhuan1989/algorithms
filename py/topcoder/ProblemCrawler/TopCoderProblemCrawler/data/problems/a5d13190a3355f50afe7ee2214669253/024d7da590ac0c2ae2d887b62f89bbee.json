Given the population of each city and the roads between cities, you must plan the tour such that no two cities directly connected by a road are assigned the same show and such that the difference between the number of people who see show 1 and those who see show 2 is minimized. You have to return the difference between the number of people who will see show 1 and those who will see show 2. <br /><br /><br /><br /> The roads between the cities are specified in the String[] <b>roads</b>. <b>roads</b><tt>[i][j]</tt> is '1' if there is a road between the i<sup>th</sup> and j<sup>th</sup> cities and is '0' if there is no road. You are guaranteed that you can pull this off. (You can schedule the shows such that no two adjacent cities are assigned the same show.) Keep in mind that each city must be assigned one of the two shows. The population of each city is specified by the int[] <b>populations</b> whose i<sup>th</sup> element is the population of the i<sup>th</sup> city.",
