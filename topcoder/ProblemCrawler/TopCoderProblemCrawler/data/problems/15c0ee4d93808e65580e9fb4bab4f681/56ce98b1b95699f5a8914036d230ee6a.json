	"statement":"You are creating a simple one-player computer game. The player must first choose and enter a string of length <b>k</b>, where each character is 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D'. Each possible string of length <b>k</b> maps to a color, and these mappings will be predetermined by you. To win the game, the player must perform a series of transformations on the string until it is different from the original, but maps to the same color. Only the following two transformations are allowed at each step: \n <ol> \n  <li>Swap two adjacent characters. </li> \n  <li>Replace an occurrence of <b>before</b>[i] in the string with <b>after</b>[i], for some index i. </li> \n </ol> You want to create an &quot;Impossible Mode&quot;, in which the player can never win. Return the minimum number of colors required to make the game impossible. ",
