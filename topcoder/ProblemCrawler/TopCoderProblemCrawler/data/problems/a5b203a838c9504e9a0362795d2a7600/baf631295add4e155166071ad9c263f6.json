	"statement":"Fox Ciel and Fox Jiro play a game called <i>Scotland Yard</i>. Their version of the game is a bit simplified, so if you know the original game, make sure you read the problem statement carefully. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> In the game Ciel and Jiro play, they use a map containing n cities. The cities are numbered 0 through n-1. The map also contains a bunch of arrows. Each arrow leads from one city to another (different) city, and has one of three possible colors. The colors represent three types of transportation: taxis, buses, and metro (subway). Both Ciel and Jiro know all information in this map. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You are given three String[]s: <b>taxi</b>, <b>bus</b>, and <b>metro</b>. The j-th character of the i-th element of <b>taxi</b> is 'Y' if it is possible to travel directly from city i to city j using a taxi, or 'N' if that is not possible. In the same way, <b>bus</b> and <b>metro</b> encode the information about bus and subway travel. Note that all transportation options are one-way. Also note that there are no additional restrictions. (That is, it may be possible to travel between some pairs of cities in both directions, there may be more than one transportation option from city i to city j, and for each transport type there can be arbitrarily many options leaving a given city.) <br /><br /> <br /><br /> The game starts by Ciel secretly choosing one of the n cities as her initial location. The game then proceeds in turns. In each turn, first Ciel moves to an adjacent location, then Jiro has the option to announce her new location. More precisely, it looks as follows: Whenever it is Ciel's turn to move, she has to move from her current city X to some other city Y. If there are no transportation options that start in the city X, Ciel announces this and the game ends. Otherwise, she chooses one of the available options and moves to its destination. Additionally, Ciel announces to Jiro the type of the transportation system she used (&quot;taxi&quot;, &quot;bus&quot;, or &quot;metro&quot;). Whenever it is Jiro's turn, if he is certain of Ciel's current city, he announces it and the game ends. Otherwise, Jiro passes and it's again Ciel's turn to move. (Note that Jiro can use all the information he has: the layout of the map, and the sequence of transportation systems Ciel already announced.) <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Ciel's score is the number of travels she made. Return Ciel's score, assuming that she plays optimally. If she can continue the game forever without being discovered by Jiro, return -1 instead.",
