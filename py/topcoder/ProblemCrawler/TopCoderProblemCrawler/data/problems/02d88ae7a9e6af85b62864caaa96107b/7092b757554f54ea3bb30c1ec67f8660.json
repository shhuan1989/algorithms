	"statement":"Magic Board is a lock that has the shape of a rectangular board, divided into a grid of n &times; m unit squares. Some of the unit squares contain a Magic Diamond. You are given the contents of the Magic Board as a String[] <b>board</b>. The number of elements in <b>board</b> is n, and the length of each element is m. Empty squares are denoted by periods ('.'), squares with a Magic Diamond are denoted by '#'. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Let S = (S[0], S[1], ...) be a sequence of cells on the board. We will consider the cells in S one after another, picking up a Magic Diamond from each of them. Doing this will unlock the Magic Board if and only if S has the following properties: \n <ul> \n  <li>S contains each cell with a Magic Diamond exactly once.</li> \n  <li>S does not contain any other cells.</li> \n  <li>For each even i, S[i] and S[i+1] are in the same row of <b>board</b>.</li> \n  <li>For each odd i, S[i] and S[i+1] are in the same column of <b>board</b>.</li> \n </ul> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You are given the String[] <b>board</b>. Determine whether this Magic Board can be unlocked. Return &quot;YES&quot; (quotes for clarity) if it can be unlocked and &quot;NO&quot; otherwise.",
