	"statement":"A positive common fraction is a fraction of the form A/B, where A and B are positive integers. An irreducible fraction is a positive common fraction such that A and B are relatively prime. (In other words, the only positive integer that divides both A and B is 1.)<br /><br /> Elly recently invented the <i>factor fractions</i>: A factor fraction is an irreducible fraction such that the product A*B is a factorial number (see Notes for definition). We will only be interested in factor fractions that lie strictly between 0 and 1. (That is, A must be strictly smaller than B.)<p></p> Examples: \n <ul> \n  <li>2/3, 4/6, 4/7, 7/7, 6/1, 42/49 are six positive common fractions</li> \n  <li>Out of those six, the following three are irreducible: 2/3, 4/7, 6/1.</li> \n  <li>The fraction 2/3 is a factor fraction, because 2*3 = 6 and that is a factorial number.</li> \n  <li>The fraction 4/7 is not a factor fraction, because 4*7 = 28 and that is not a factorial number.</li> \n  <li>The fraction 6/1 is a factor fraction, because 6*1 = 6 and that is a factorial number. However, as 6/1 does not lie strictly between 0 and 1, we are not interested in this fraction.</li> \n  <li>Note that 4/6 is not a factor fraction. (We do have 4*6=24, but a factor fraction has to be irreducible.)</li> \n </ul> <p></p> You are given an int <b>N</b>. Compute and return the number of factor fractions A/B such that 0 &lt; A/B &lt; 1 and A*B is one of the factorial numbers from 1! to <b>N</b>! (inclusive).",
