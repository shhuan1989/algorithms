	"statement":"You work for a very large company that markets many different products. In some cases, one product you market competes with another. To help deal with this situation you have split the intended consumers into two groups, namely Adults and Teenagers. If your company markets 2 products that compete with each other, selling one to Adults and the other to Teenagers will help maximize profits. Given a list of the products that compete with each other, you are going to determine whether all can be marketed such that no pair of competing products are both sold to Teenagers or both sold to Adults. If such an arrangement is not feasible your method will return -1. Otherwise, it should return the number of possible ways of marketing all of the products.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> The products will be given in a String[] <b>compete</b> whose k<sup>th</sup> element describes product k. The k<sup>th</sup> element will be a single-space delimited list of integers. These integers will refer to the products that the k<sup>th</sup> product competes with. For example:<pre>\n<b>compete</b> = {&quot;1 4&quot;,\n            &quot;2&quot;,\n            &quot;3&quot;,\n            &quot;0&quot;,\n\t    &quot;&quot;}\n</pre> The example above shows product 0 competes with 1 and 4, product 1 competes with 2, product 2 competes with 3, and product 3 competes with 0. Note, competition is symmetric so product 1 competing with product 2 means product 2 competes with product 1 as well.<br /><br /> Ways to market:<br /><br /> 1) 0 to Teenagers, 1 to Adults, 2 to Teenagers, 3 to Adults, and 4 to Adults<br /><br /> 2) 0 to Adults, 1 to Teenagers, 2 to Adults, 3 to Teenagers, and 4 to Teenagers<br /><br /> Your method would return 2.
