	"statement":"You are given a set of integers called <b>luckySet</b>. An interval [A,B], where B is greater than A, and A and B are positive integers, is considered unlucky if none of the integers between A and B, inclusive, belongs to <b>luckySet</b>.<br /><br /><br /><br /> An integer x is considered to be luckier than another integer y if the number of unlucky intervals that contain x is smaller than the number of unlucky intervals that contain y. In case both x and y belong to an equal number of unlucky intervals, or both belong to an infinite number of unlucky intervals, the smallest of them is considered to be luckier than the other.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Given a int[] <b>luckySet</b>, return the top <b>n</b> luckiest positive integers sorted in descending order by luckiness (in other words, each element of the int[] must be luckier than the next element).",
