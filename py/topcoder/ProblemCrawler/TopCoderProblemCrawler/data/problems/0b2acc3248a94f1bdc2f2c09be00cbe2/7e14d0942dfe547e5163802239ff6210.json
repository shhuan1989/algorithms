	"statement":"<p> Consider a circle in the plane. </p> <p> You are given an int <b>places</b>. This is the number of places that are equally spaced along the perimeter of the circle, i.e., the distance between any two consecutive places is equal. The places are numbered 0 to <b>places</b>-1 in clockwise order, starting at an arbitrary place. </p> <p> We will now draw red points in some of the places. The number of red points is given as an int <b>points</b>. As the number of points may be large, we will generate them using a simple process that is described below. </p> <p> Finally, once all points are generated, your task is to find and return the number of <i>right triangles</i> that have all three vertices in red points. </p> <p> To generate the points, you are given three ints <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b>. For n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., <b>points</b>-1, execute the following steps: </p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Compute P[n] = (<b>a</b>*n*n + <b>b</b>*n + <b>c</b>) modulo <b>places</b>.</li> \n  <li>Starting at P[n], find the first place in the clockwise direction that does not contain a red point.</li> \n  <li>Put a red point onto that place.</li> \n </ul>",
