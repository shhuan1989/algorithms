	"statement":"There is a square on a plane with (0,0) as its lower left and (2^<b>N</b>+2, 2^<b>N</b>+2) as its upper right corner. It is known that <b>K</b> distinct points have to be painted. Each of them should be strictly inside the square and should have integral coordinates. The first point to be painted is always (1,1). For each of the next points, the one from which the Euclidean distance to the closest already painted point is maximum should be chosen. In case of ties, the leftmost point should be painted. If there are still several possibilities, the lowermost point is chosen. Return int[] with exactly two elements, the X and Y coordinates of the <b>K</b>-th point to be painted.",
