	"statement":"Your task is to find <b>n</b> positive integers. We will label them x[0] through x[<b>n</b>-1]. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> We will give you some information about these integers. Namely, for some pairs of integers we will tell you their greatest common divisor (GCD), and for some pairs we will tell you their least common multiple (LCM). <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You are given the int <b>n</b>. You are also given a String <b>type</b> and three int[]s: <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b>. These int[]s will all have the same number of elements, and <b>type</b> will contain the corresponding number of characters. Their meaning is as follows: For each valid i, we have some information about the integers x[ <b>A</b>[i] ] and x[ <b>B</b>[i] ]. If <b>type</b>[i] is 'G', the greatest common divisor of these two integers must be <b>C</b>[i]. If <b>type</b>[i] is 'L', the least common multiple of these two integers must be <b>C</b>[i]. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Return &quot;Solution exists&quot; (quotes for clarity) if there is at least one way to choose x[0] through x[<b>n</b>-1] so that all requirements are satisfied. Otherwise, return &quot;Solution does not exist&quot;.",
