	"statement":"<p> A line of symmetry is a line through the cartesian plane such that if you reflect everything from one side of the line to the other, you still have the same image. For example, if the x-axis is a line of symmetry, it means that for every point (x,y) there is also a point (x,-y). </p><p> Your task is, given a list of points, determine how many such lines exist. </p>",
