	"statement":"<p> In a Las Vegas casino, a new type of six-sided die is being introduced. These dice may have any positive integers written its sides, but no two sides of the same die can contain the same number. For each die, the casino owner wants the mean value of the numbers written on its sides to not exceed <b>M</b>. </p> <p> Compute the total number of allowed dice. Two dice are considered different if one can't be obtained from the other using rotations. Since the resulting number may be quite large, return it modulo 1000000007. </p>",
