	"statement":"A die has 6 sides, numbered 1-6, and each side is equally likely to come up after a roll. In this problem, you are to consider rolling <b>N</b> dice in <b>K</b> rounds. In each round, you select a subset of the dice rolled in the previous round (you have to roll them all in the first round) and reroll that subset (note that a subset can be all the dice from the previous round). After <b>K</b> rounds, you pick a number between 1 and 6 inclusive and multiply it by the number of dice showing that number. Your goal is to maximize this value.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Assuming optimal play, what is the maximum expected score for a given <b>N</b> and <b>K</b>?",
