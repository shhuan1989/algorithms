	"statement":"A microbiologist wants us to partition a collection of strings into disjoint groups based on common prefixes. The desired partition is formed by the following process:<pre>\n \n    while there are at least 2 strings that have not been assigned to a group:\n        find the longest prefix that appears in at least 2 unassigned strings\n        form a new group consisting of all unassigned strings having that prefix\n    if there is an unassigned string, assign it to its own group\n</pre> Note that the &quot;longest prefix&quot; in the algorithm above may have length 0. <p> We want to produce a listing of the strings organized by group, with a string of '-'s following the members of each group. The '-' string should contain one '-' for each character in the common prefix of the group. So a group whose common prefix has length 0 should be followed by the string &quot;&quot;. As a special case, a group that contains just one string is considered to have a common prefix of length 0. </p><p> List the groups with the longest common prefix first. Among groups with the same length common prefix, list the groups alphabetically. Among strings within a group, list the strings alphabetically. Given a String[] <b>protein</b>, return a String[] that is the desired listing. </p> ",
