	"statement":"Fox Ciel and Cat Snuke decided to organize a programming contest. They are discussing the scoring system of the contest now. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> They prepared N problems for the contest. Each contestant will solve a subset of these problems, and total score of the contestant will be the sum of the point values assigned to the problems solved by the contestant. Ciel thinks the i-th problem should be worth <b>c</b>[i] points. Snuke thinks the i-th problem should be worth <b>s</b>[i] points. For example, suppose that Ciel chose the point values <b>c</b> = {30, 50, 20}. Let X = {0, 2} be the 0-based indices of problems a contestant solved. Then Ciel's scoring system would assign the score 30 + 20 = 50 to this contestant. We will denote this as follows: C(X) = 50. Similarly S(X) is defined by Snuke's scoring system. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Check whether these scoring systems are equivalent, and return &quot;Equivalent&quot; or &quot;Not Equivalent&quot;. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Formally, these two scoring systems are equivalent if for any two sets of problem indices X, Y one of the following three conditions holds: \n <ul> \n  <li>C(X) &lt; C(Y) and S(X) &lt; S(Y)</li> \n  <li>C(X) = C(Y) and S(X) = S(Y)</li> \n  <li>C(X) &gt; C(Y) and S(X) &gt; S(Y)</li> \n </ul>",
