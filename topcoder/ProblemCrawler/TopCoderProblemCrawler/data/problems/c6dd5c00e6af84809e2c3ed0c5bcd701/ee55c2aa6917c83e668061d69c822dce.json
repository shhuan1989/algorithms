In other words, they get to keep a certain percentage of the sales they make. You have a saleswoman working for you who gets a whopping 20% commission, which cuts deep into your profit margins. You are considering replacing her with a cheaper salesman who will keep <b>commission</b>% of his sales. Out of each sale, <b>cost</b>% of the sale goes towards the cost of your products and other overhead. Your current saleswoman sells $<b>sales</b> of products a year. Your task is to determine how much the potential salesman would have to sell in a year to make you the same profit.",
