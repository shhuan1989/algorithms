	"statement":"Manao is working in the Tree Research Center. It may come as a surprise that the trees they research are not the ones you can see in a park. Instead, they are researching special graphs. (See Notes for definitions of terms related to these trees.) <br /><br /><br /><br /> Manao's daily job is reconstructing trees, given some partial information about them. Today Manao faced a difficult task. He needed to find the maximum possible diameter of a tree, given the following information: \n <ul> \n  <li>Some vertex in the tree is called V.</li> \n  <li>The distance between V and the farthest vertex from V is D.</li> \n  <li>For each x between 1 and D, inclusive, Manao knows the number of vertices such that their distance from V is x.</li> \n </ul> You are given a int[] <b>cnt</b> containing D strictly positive integers. For each i, the i-th element of <b>cnt</b> is equal to the number of vertices which have distance i+1 from V. Please help Manao with his task. Return the maximum possible diameter of a tree that matches the given information. ",
