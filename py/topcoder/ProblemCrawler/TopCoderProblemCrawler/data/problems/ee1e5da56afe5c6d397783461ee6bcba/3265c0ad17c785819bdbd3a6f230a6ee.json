	"statement":"Andrew has an interesting contraption. There are two nails and n pulleys on his table. The nails are points with coordinates (0, 0) and ((<b>n</b>+1)*<b>d</b>, 0). Each pulley is a circle with radius <b>r</b>. The centers of the pulleys are at the points (<b>d</b>, 0), (2*<b>d</b>, 0), ..., and (<b>n</b>*<b>d</b>, 0). The constraints guarantee that no two pulleys overlap. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Andrew wants to connect the two nails using a piece of rope. His only condition is that the rope must be perfectly taut. In other words, there must be no slack anywhere on the rope. (Assume that the width of the rope is negligible and that the length of the rope is not limited.) <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Of course, the rope cannot go directly from one nail to the other, because the pulleys are in the way. The rope has to go around them somehow: touching some of them, or even wrapping around them. The rope is even allowed to touch the same point on a pulley arbitrarily many times. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Given these constraints it's easy to see that there are infinitely many ways how to stretch the rope between the two nails. Note that two ways are considered different if the rope follows a different curve, even if the length of the rope is exactly the same in both ways. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Andrew ordered all possible ways according to the length of the rope used. (The order starts with the shortest ways, and ties are broken arbitrarily.) You are given the ints <b>d</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>n</b> (as described above), and a long <b>k</b>. Return the length of the rope used in the <b>k</b>-th (1-based index) way in his ordered list.",
