	"statement":"<p><i> Recently, I realized that a rating graph can have two different intervals that look quite similar. Write a program that would detect such intervals. </i></p> <br /><br /> <p> You're given a user's rating graph in two int[]s: <tt><b>date</b></tt> and <tt><b>rating</b></tt>. Suppose that a user has participated in <tt>N</tt> contests; for <tt>0 &lt;= i &lt; N</tt>, the <tt>i</tt>-th contest has timestamp <tt><b>date</b>[i]</tt> and the user's rating after this contest was <tt><b>rating</b>[i]</tt>. </p> <br /><br /> <p> Formally, the rating graph is a sequence of points <tt>(<b>date</b>[i],<b>rating</b>[i])</tt>; an interval of the rating graph is a contiguous subsequence of those points - i.e., a subsequence corresponding to a contiguous range of indices. Two intervals are similar if one can be obtained from the other only by translation and scaling by a positive real factor (zooming). Note that both dimensions must be scaled by the same factor. </p> <br /><br /> <p> Consider the polyline obtained by visiting the points of an interval of the rating graph in order. The total length of this polyline is called the length of that interval. </p> <br /><br /> <p> Find the longest interval <tt>I</tt> of the given rating graph that's similar to some other (possibly partially overlapping) interval of that same rating graph and return the length of <tt>I</tt>. </p>",
