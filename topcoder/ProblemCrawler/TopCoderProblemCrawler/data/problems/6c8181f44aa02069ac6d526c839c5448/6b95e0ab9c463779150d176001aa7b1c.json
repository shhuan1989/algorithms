	"statement":"Cat Ctu is going to buy some robots. His budget is <b>B</b> dollars. You are given int[]s <b>cost</b> and <b>cap</b> that describe a store. For each valid i, the store sells one robot that costs <b>cost</b>[i] dollars and has a fuel tank that can hold at most <b>cap</b>[i] units of fuel. Initially, all robots have a full fuel tank. Ctu can purchase any subset of these robots, as long as he does not exceed his budget. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Once Ctu purchases some robots, he will number them sequentially, starting from 1. Note that he may number them in any order - he is not required to preserve the order in which the robots' parameters are given in <b>cost</b> and <b>cap</b>. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> The robots are going to travel along a straight line. They will all start at the position 0 on the line. Ctu wants to send a robot as far as possible in the positive direction. Precise rules of robot movement are given below. <br /><br /> \n <ul> \n  <li>The robots' movement is continuous. They are able to travel arbitrary positive real distances.</li> \n  <li>Moving 1 unit of distance consumes 1 unit of fuel.</li> \n  <li>The robots will initially all travel together in the positive direction. One by one, in the order given by their numbers, the robots will then turn back. Multiple robots with consecutive numbers may turn back at the same position.</li> \n  <li>Each robot must return back to position 0.</li> \n  <li>As a robot turns back, it can donate any amount of fuel to the next robot. (I.e., for each valid k, robot k may donate some of its fuel to robot k+1. Note that after the donation robot k must still have enough fuel to get back to position 0.)</li> \n  <li>The amount of fuel a robot carries can never exceed the initial capacity of its fuel tank.</li> \n </ul> <br /><br /> Given that Ctu buys the optimal subset of robots he can afford, and given that he then numbers and programs them optimally, compute and return the largest position that can be reached by one of Ctu's robots.",

If they cooperate, one of these robots can reach the position 2/3 = 0.666666667. Here's how an optimal program looks like: Both robots travel together to the position 1/3. At this moment, each of them has 2/3 of a unit of fuel in its fuel tank. Robot 1 donates 1/3 of a unit of fuel to robot 2 and turns back. Robot 2 now has a full fuel tank again. It continues to the position 2/3. There it turns back and returns to position 0.",
