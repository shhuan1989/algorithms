	"statement":"You are playing a strategy game and you wish to train the strongest army for the final fight. There are creatures of <i>N</i> levels in the game, numbered from 0 to <i>N</i>-1, inclusive. You already have some creatures in your army and <b>D</b> days to train them. The number of creatures you have is given in a int[] <b>count</b>. It contains <i>N</i> elements and its <i>i</i>-th element is the number of creatures of level <i>i</i>.<br /><br /><br /><br /> During each day, you can choose one creature and train it. Training increases a creature's level by 1, i.e., a creature of level 0 becomes a creature of level 1, a creature of level 1 becomes a creature of level 2, and so on. The only exception is creatures of level <i>N</i>-1 - such creatures can't be trained as <i>N</i>-1 is the largest possible level. You can train the same creature during more than one day. For example, if you train a creature during 3 days, it will gain 3 levels. You can also skip days and not train any creatures during those days.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given a int[] <b>power</b>, where the <i>i</i>-th element of <b>power</b> is the power of one creature of level <i>i</i>. The power of your army is the sum of the powers of all its creatures. Return the maximum possible power your army can have after all <b>D</b> days of training are finished.",
