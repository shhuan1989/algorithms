	"statement":"Consider a string T containing exactly L characters. The string T(i) is a cyclic shift of T starting from position i (0 &lt;= i &lt; L). T(i) contains exactly the same number of characters as T. For each j between 0 and L-1, inclusive, character j of T(i) is equal to character (i+j)%L of T. Let's call T a <i>magic word</i> if there are exactly K positions i such that T(i) = T.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given a String[] <b>S</b> containing exactly N words. For each permutation p = (p[0], p[1], ..., p[N-1]) of integers between 0 and N-1, inclusive, we can define a string generated by this permutation as a concatenation <b>S</b>[p[0]] + <b>S</b>[p[1]] + ... + <b>S</b>[p[N-1]]. Return the number of permutations that generate magic words. All indices in this problem as 0-based. ",
