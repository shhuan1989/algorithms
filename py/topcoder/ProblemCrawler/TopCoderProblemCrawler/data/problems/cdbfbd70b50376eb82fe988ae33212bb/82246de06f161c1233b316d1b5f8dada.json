	"statement":"<p>Alice is playing a game with Bob.</p> <br /><br /> <p>The game is played on a binary tree of N vertices, which are numbered from 0 to N-1. (In this problem, a binary tree is any rooted tree in which each vertex has <i>at most</i> two children.) For each integer i such that 0 &lt;= i &lt; N-1, an undirected edge with cost <b>cost</b>[i] connects vertex <b>parent</b>[i] and vertex i+1. If there is no value of i such that <b>parent</b>[i] = X, then vertex X is called a <i>leaf</i>. Bob has a token which starts on vertex 0. At each step of the game:</p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Bob selects an edge which is adjacent to his token.</li> \n  <li>Alice may choose to permanently remove the edge and pay the cost associated with it. If she does so, the move is cancelled.</li> \n  <li>Otherwise, Bob moves the token along the edge.</li> \n </ul> <p>Bob cannot use any edge more than twice (once in each direction). If Bob?s token ever reaches a leaf, Alice loses the game. Alice wins if Bob has no valid moves.</p> <br /><br /> <p>Alice can always win the game. She would like to do so while minimizing the total cost she pays, while Bob wants to maximize it. Assuming both players play optimally, return the cost paid by Alice.</p> ",
