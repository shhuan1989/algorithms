	"statement":"John is playing with balls. All of the balls are identical in weight and considered to have a zero radius. All balls are located on the same straight line and can move only along this line. If a ball rolling to the right and a ball rolling to the left at the same speed collide, they do not change speed, but they change direction. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You are given int[] <b>x</b>. <b>x</b>[i] is the initial position of the i-th ball. John decides the direction for each ball (right or left) with equal probability. At time 0, he rolls the balls in the chosen directions simultaneously at a speed of one unit per second. Return the expected number of bounces between all balls during <b>T</b> seconds (including those collisions that happen exactly at <b>T</b> seconds).",
