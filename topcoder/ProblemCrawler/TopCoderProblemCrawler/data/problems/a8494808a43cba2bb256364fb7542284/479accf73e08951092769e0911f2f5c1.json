For example, if <b>N</b> is 166, you can reach the following numbers in one operation: 506 (swap '1' and the first '6'), 155 (swap the '6's) and 560 (swap '1' and the last '6'). You are allowed to perform the operation zero or more times consecutively. Return the largest number you can reach. </p>",
