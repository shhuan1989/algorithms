I'll show you a magic trick. Please imagine a positive integer less than or equal to 16.<br /><br /> Hanako: OK. I imagined it.<br /><br /> Taro: (Taro shows card 1 to Hanako.) Does this card contain your number?<br /><br /> Hanako: Yes.<br /><br /> Taro: (Taro shows card 2 to Hanako.) Does this card contain your number?<br /><br /> Hanako: No.<br /><br /> Taro: (Taro shows card 3 to Hanako.) Does this card contain your number?<br /><br /> Hanako: Yes.<br /><br /> Taro: (Taro shows card 4 to Hanako.) Does this card contain your number?<br /><br /> Hanako: Yes.<br /><br /> Taro: Your number is 5!<br /><br /> </i> <br /><br /> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/NumberMagic/cards.jpg\" /> <br /><br /> (Card 1 contains 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Card 2 contains 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Card 3 contains 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13 and 14. Card 4 contains 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15.) <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Let's generalize this magic trick. Hanako imagines a positive integer less than or equal to <b>N</b>. Each card must contain exactly <b>M</b> different integers between 1 and <b>N</b>, inclusive. Taro must be able to determine Hanako's number correctly using her answers to his questions. Return the minimal number of cards required to perform this magic trick successfully every time.",
