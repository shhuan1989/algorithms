	"statement":"You are selling a number of boxes of berries to a distributor. You are paid per berry, but the distributor only knows how many boxes you are shipping - not how many berries are in each box. To get around this, the distributor employs inspectors to estimate the total number of berries. Each inspector will take a sample of the boxes, count the berries in each of the sample boxes, and use this to extrapolate the total number of berries to pay for. It is up to you to decide how many berries to put in each individual box. The total number of berries to package is given in <b>berries</b>, and all berries must be used. You can put between 1 and 9 berries, inclusive, in each box. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Each inspector <i>n</i> starts at the box numbered <b>first</b>[n] and then proceeds to box <b>first</b>[n]+<b>period</b>[n] and continues inspecting boxes until reaching the end of the boxes (boxes begin numbering at zero). If an inspector were to see a total of 30 berries in the 20 boxes looked at, and if there were 25 boxes altogether, that inspector would give an estimate of 30*25/20=37.5 berries for the entire shipment. If an inspector does not open any boxes, that inspector will estimate that there are zero berries in the shipment. More than one inspector may look at the same box. You will be paid based on the average estimate of the inspectors. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Since you know which boxes each inspector will look at, it is in your best interest to put more berries in those boxes and to choose a number of boxes that will make your shipment seem as large as possible. Assuming that you do so, what is the maximum number of berries you will be paid for? ",
