	"statement":"<p>Fox Jiro likes dice. He wants to make his own dice. Each die he wants to make is a cube. Each of the 6 faces has an integer between 1 and <b>N</b>, inclusive. No two faces have same number. Also the following condition must be satisfied: for all faces, the sum of the numbers on opposite faces must be equal and the sum must be greater than or equal to <b>K</b>.</p> <br /><br /> <p>He realized that there are many ways to make such dice. He wants to know how many ways there are. Please help Jiro to make a program that is given two integers <b>N</b> and <b>K</b> and returns the number of different dice satisfying the condition mentioned above.</p> <br /><br /> <p>Two dice are considered the same if you can rotate one to form the other.</p> ",
