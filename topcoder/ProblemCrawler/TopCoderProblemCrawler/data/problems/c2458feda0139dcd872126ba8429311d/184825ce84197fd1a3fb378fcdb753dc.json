Note that a subsequence doesn't have to be contiguous.</li> \n  <li>There is no longer word with properties 1 and 2.</li> \n </ol> Examples: \n <ul> \n  <li>Ciel does not like &quot;ABBA&quot; because there are two consecutive 'B's.</li> \n  <li>Ciel does not like &quot;THETOPCODER&quot; because it contains the subsequence &quot;TETE&quot;.</li> \n  <li>Ciel does not like &quot;ABACADA&quot; because it contains the subsequence &quot;AAAA&quot;. (Note that here x=y='A'.)</li> \n  <li>Ciel does not like &quot;ABCA&quot; because &quot;ABCBA&quot; is longer.</li> \n  <li>If <b>n</b>=1 and the one letter Ciel uses is 'A', then she likes the word &quot;A&quot;.</li> \n  <li>If <b>n</b>=2 and the two letters Ciel uses are 'A' and 'B', then she likes the words &quot;ABA&quot; and &quot;BAB&quot;.</li> \n </ul> Given the int <b>n</b>, compute and return the number of words Ciel likes, modulo 1,000,000,007.",
