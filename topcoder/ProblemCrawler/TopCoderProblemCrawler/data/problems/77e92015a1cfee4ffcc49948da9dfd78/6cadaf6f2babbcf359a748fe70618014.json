	"statement":"Alice is about to set out in her car on a long journey. Her car's fuel tank can only carry <b>fuelTank</b> units of fuel, so she may have to stop at gas stations along the way to refuel. Prices vary across different stations, so she needs to plan ahead to minimize the total cost of the journey. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> The network of roads Alice is driving on is represented by an undirected graph with N nodes, in which she starts at node 0 and wishes to get to node 1. Initially, there is no fuel in her car's fuel tank. There is a fuel station located at each node and the cost per unit fuel at node i is <b>fuelCost[i]</b>. The graph is described by a String[] <b>roads</b>. The concatenation of the elements of <b>roads</b> forms a space-separated list of <i>edges</i>. Each <i>edge</i> is formatted &quot;<tt>i,j,fuel</tt>&quot; (quotes for clarity), in which <tt>i</tt>, <tt>j</tt> and <tt>fuel</tt> are integers formatted without leading zeros. This denotes that there is a bidirectional road connecting nodes <tt>i</tt> and <tt>j</tt> and <tt>fuel</tt> units of fuel will be consumed from the fuel tank in traversing this road. Alice doesn't want to end up stranded, so she cannot traverse a road with less than <tt>fuel</tt> units of fuel in the tank (although she can safely drive the road with exactly enough fuel). <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Return the minimum cost of completing the journey or -1 if it is impossible to get from node 0 to node 1.",
