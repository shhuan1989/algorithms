	"statement":"<p> A travel agent is organizing tours for a group of people. He is charging a fixed <b>fee</b> to the whole group for each tour they take. The company policy, however, forces him to make each tour completely different from other tours because tourists don't want to see the same sight twice. </p><p> Each tour the agent plans starts at the group's hotel, consists of a sequence of distinct sights and ends at the hotel. The agent has managed to get the best price on transportation from the hotel to each of the sights, and between the sights. All transportation is directed, which means the cost to travel from A to B may be different from the cost to travel from B to A. The overall cost of a tour is the sum of all the transportation costs in the tour. </p><p> You will be given the information the agent has. The <b>fee</b> will be given as an int. The transportation costs between sights or between each sight and the hotel are given in two String[]s, <b>c</b> and <b>d</b>. Character j of element i of <b>c</b> and <b>d</b> give the first and second digit, respectively, in base-64 coding (explained in the notes), of the cost to the agency of transporting the whole group from point i to point j. Point 0 is always the hotel, while all the other points are the sights. You have to return the maximum income the agency can make by allocating tours. The income will be the fee multiplied by the number of tours, minus the total costs of all transportation needed. See the examples for further clarification. </p>",
