	"statement":"<p> Consider the following problem: </p> <p><i> &quot;In the country of Absurdistan there are N airports. Each airport is either big or small. It is known that for each big airport there are at least B flights leaving it, and for each small airport there are at most S flights leaving it. Each flight is bidirectional and connects exactly two airports. No two flights connect the same pair of airports. It is possible to travel from any airport to any other airport using some sequence of flights. Determine the number of big airports. Find all solutions.&quot; </i></p> <p> Let A(N,B,S) be the number of solutions the above task has for a given triple N, B, S. You are given six ints: <b>Nlo</b>, <b>Nhi</b>, <b>Blo</b>, <b>Bhi</b>, <b>Slo</b> and <b>Shi</b>. Your method must compute and return the sum of A(N,B,S) over all N, B, S such that all following constraints hold: </p> \n <ul> \n  <li><b>Nlo</b> &lt;= N &lt;= <b>Nhi</b></li> \n  <li><b>Blo</b> &lt;= B &lt;= <b>Bhi</b></li> \n  <li><b>Slo</b> &lt;= S &lt;= <b>Shi</b></li> \n  <li>S &lt; B</li> \n </ul>",
