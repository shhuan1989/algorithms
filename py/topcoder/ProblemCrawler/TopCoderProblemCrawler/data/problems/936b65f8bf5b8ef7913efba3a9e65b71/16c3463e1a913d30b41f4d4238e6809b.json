	"statement":"When a paragraph is justified, the widths of the spaces on each line except the last are adjusted so that each line except the last has exactly the same width. This is done in such a way that each space within a line has the same width (spaces can have any width, not just integral ones). This can lead to some lines with undesirably wide spaces. For example, if each line is 20 characters long, and one line contains 10 characters and 1 space, while the next contains 15 characters and 3 spaces, the space in the first line will be far wider than the spaces in the next line.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Your task is to find a way to place the words in a paragrah so that the width of the widest space is as small as possible. You may assume that each letter has the same width, and that each space must be at least as wide as one letter. You will be given a String[], <b>paragraph</b>, representing the text to be justified, and an int <b>width</b>, indicating the width (in letters) that each line except the last must have. You should always place at least two words on each line except the last (the constraints ensure this is possible). The constraints will ensure that the return is unique. You should return a String[], each element of which represents a single line. Keep in mind that the last line of the return will not be justified. Words within a line should be separated by single spaces, and there should be no leading or trailing spaces. ",
