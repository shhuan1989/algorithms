	"statement":"<p> A rectangular polygon is a polygon whose edges are all parallel to the coordinate axes. The polygon must have a single, non-intersecting boundary. </p> <p> You are given several horizontal line segments. You may remove some of the given segments and add any number of vertical segments to construct a rectangular polygon. Your goal is to maximize the number of edges in the final polygon. </p> <p> You will be given int[]s <b>x1</b>, <b>x2</b>, and <b>y</b>. (<b>x1[i]</b>, <b>y[i]</b>) and (<b>x2[i]</b>, <b>y[i]</b>) are the end points of the i-th line segment. The given segments will have no common points. Return the maximal number of edges in a polygon that can be constructed using the above method. If no polygon can be constructed, return 0. </p> ",
