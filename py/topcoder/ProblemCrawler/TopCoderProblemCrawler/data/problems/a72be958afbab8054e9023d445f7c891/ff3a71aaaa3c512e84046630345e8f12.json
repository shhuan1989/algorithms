	"statement":"You will be given a list of line segments in an infinite x-y plane. Your method should return how many separate regions there are in the plane once the segments are added. Two points are in the same region if there exists a path from one point to the other that doesn't cross a line segment. The line segments will be given in a String[] <b>lines</b>. Each element of <b>lines</b> will be a single space delimited list of 4 integers. The elements will be formatted as (quotes for clarity) &quot;x0 y0 x1 y1&quot; denoting a line segment from (x0,y0) to (x1,y1). Note that there will always be exactly 1 infinite region that is not completely enclosed by the given line segments. In addition, to make things easier, the line segments will only be horizontal, vertical or diagonal (a diagonal line segment is one whose slope is 1 or -1).",
