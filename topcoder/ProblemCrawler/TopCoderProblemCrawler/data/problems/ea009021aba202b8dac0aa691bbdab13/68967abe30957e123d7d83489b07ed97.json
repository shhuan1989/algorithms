People from the same country are all sitting together. </p> <p> A reporter has already approached some of the people and asked each of them the same question: &quot;How many people from your country (including you) are here?&quot; All the people who were asked the question gave her correct answers. </p> <p> You are given a int[] <b>a</b>. The elements of <b>a</b> correspond to the people in the row, in order. For each i, element i of <b>a</b> is either 0 if the corresponding person was not asked the question, or a positive integer: the answer given by that person. </p> <p> The reporter just realized that she might be able to reconstruct all the missing answers from the answers she already knows. Return &quot;Sufficient&quot; if she can do that, or &quot;Insufficient&quot; if she cannot. </p>",
