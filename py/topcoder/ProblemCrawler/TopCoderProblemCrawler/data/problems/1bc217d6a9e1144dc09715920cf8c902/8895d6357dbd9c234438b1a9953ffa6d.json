Our data is a collection of records, but some workers have multiple records, and some of the records are missing some of the information. We would like to untangle the mess. At least, we would like to figure out how many different workers we have! <p> Each worker has his own unique id that is a string of digits, the first of which is always zero ('0'). Each worker has a name consisting of uppercase letters 'A'-'Z', and has an age that is an integer with no leading zeros. Neither name nor age can be relied upon to be unique. Each data record contains information for a single worker, and is formatted to contain no leading or trailing spaces. It may contain 1, 2, or all 3 of the fields (name, age, id) in any order. The fields within a record will be separated by one or more spaces. </p><p> Create a class DataFilter that contains a method untangle that is given a String[] <b>data</b> that contains the records and returns the number of different workers we have. </p><p> Each element of <b>data</b> consists of one or more records, separated from each other by a single semicolon (';'). If there is more than one way to untangle the data, return the smallest possible number of workers. If there is no consistent interpretation of the data, return -1. </p> ",
