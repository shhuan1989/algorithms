	"statement":"<p> There are several companies on the market, with each company processing some data in order to produce data in a new company-specific format. When a company gets a unit of input data, it produces a unit of new data. Unfortunately, each company can process only some limited amount of data, and each company can accept only some specific data formats. Of course, running each company costs the owner some money. </p> <p> The information about the companies will be given to you in a String[] <b>names</b>, a String[] <b>process</b>, a int[] <b>cost</b> and a int[] <b>amount</b>. <b>names</b>[i] is the name of the i-th company. <b>process</b>[i] is a single-space delimited list of companies which can process the data produced by the i-th company. <b>cost</b>[i] is the cost of running the i-th company, and <b>amount</b>[i] is the maximal amount of data that the i-th company can process. </p> <p> Also you will be given two companies - <b>company1</b> and <b>company2</b>. The company <b>company1</b> has an infinite amount of unprocessed data in its supply which can be processed. Your goal is to convert as much data as possible to the new format of <b>company2</b>, spending the least amount of money as possible. You are to select the companies you want to run, since only running companies can process the data. Return the names of those companies as a String[], sorted in lexicographical order. If more than one answer is possible, return the lexicographically smallest one. If there is no way <b>company2</b> can process any data at all, return an empty String[]. </p> ",

			"note":"topcoder has an unlimited amount of data. We take 21 units of topcoder data, with 10 units going to doodle and 11 to nasa. When doodle processes all 10 units, all 10 units of the output go to idm, and, after being processed by idm, those 10 units continue to kintel. 11 units of data processed by nasa are split between ninny (9 units) and idm (2 units). Both those companies give their output to kintel, which has enough power to process all 21 units of data it gets. Therefore the optimal strategy is to run all the companies except \"noname\". ",
