	"statement":"You regularly participate in problem solving contests. During a contest all contestants must solve 3 problems, submitting their solutions to the judges for some points. After the competition, the judges will check the correctness of the problems, and award 0 points for incorrect problems. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You want to know your result as soon as possible and you hate waiting for the judges to finish their work. You are ambitious and you are only interested in knowing if you will finish among the top 5 people. Thus you decide to write your own program to determine your probability of getting a top 5 spot. Notice that if someone gets the same score as you, they will go above you on the top scorers list. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You will be given two String[]s - <b>results</b>, giving you the points all people have scored for their problems (prior to being judged), and <b>accuracies</b>, the submission accuracies for all people (the i<sup>th</sup> element of <b>results</b> corresponds to the i<sup>th</sup> element of <b>accuracies</b>). Each element of <b>results</b> and <b>accuracies</b> will contain three space-delimited integers without extra leading zeroes. For the i<sup>th</sup> contestant the corresponding element of <b>results</b> contains the points this contestant received for his three solutions, and the corresponding element of <b>accuracies</b> represents the probabilities in percents of these solutions to be correct. <br /><br /> Given the <b>points</b> you have (you think all your solutions are correct), return the probability you will make the top 5.",
