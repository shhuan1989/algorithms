	"statement":"There are N cards which are initially blank. First, Taro writes a distinct number between 1 and N, inclusive, on the front side of each card. The number he writes on the i-th card is <b>taro</b>[i]. Then, Hanako turns over all the cards and writes a distinct number between 1 and N, inclusive, on the back side of each card. The number she writes on the i-th card is <b>hanako</b>[i]. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Now you must determine the number of distinct ways that the N cards can be arranged in a row. The cards can be placed in any order and each card can be oriented so that either its front side or back side is displayed. Two arrangements are considered distinct if the i-th card in the row shows a different number in one arrangement than it does it in the other. Return the number of distinct possible arrangements, modulo 1,000,000,007.",
