	"statement":"Camomile and her twin sister Romashka are playing a game. At the beginning of the game, they are given a word. Then, starting with Camomile, they take alternate turns, and on each turn, the player erases one letter from the word. That letter must be at a position greater than or equal to the position of the letter erased on the previous turn (on the first turn, the player can erase any letter). Letter positions are numbered consecutively from left to right and are renumbered from scratch after each turn. For example, if the word is &quot;topcoder&quot; and a player erases the letter 'c', the word would become &quot;topoder&quot;, and on the next turn, the other player could only erase the letters 'r', 'e', 'd' or the second 'o'. <br /><br /><br /><br /> When a player erases the last letter, the game ends. If the word at the end of the game is lexicographically greater than the word at the beginning, Camomile wins. Otherwise, Romashka wins. You are given a String <b>word</b>, which is the word given at the beginning of the game. Assuming that Romashka and Camomile both play optimally, return &quot;Romashka&quot; if Romashka will win or &quot;Camomile&quot; if Camomile will win (all quotes for clarity).",
