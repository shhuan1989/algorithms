	"statement":"<p> Fizz Buzz is a simple game used to teach kids about divisibility. The goal of the game is to say positive integers in increasing order, with a twist: You don't say the numbers divisible by 3 and 5. Instead, whenever a number was divisible by 3 you say &quot;fizz&quot; and for a number divisible by 5 you say &quot;buzz&quot;. (Thus, if a number was divisible by 15, you say &quot;fizzbuzz&quot;.) </p> <p> Here is how the game starts: 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz, 16, 17, fizz, 19, buzz, fizz, 22, 23, fizz, buzz, 26, fizz, 28, 29, fizzbuzz, 31, 32, fizz, 34, buzz, fizz, ... </p> <p> Fizz Buzz has also become a traditional programming interview question. However, in this problem we have a more tricky assignment for you. </p> <p> You are given longs <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. Consider the part of the game that corresponds to integers from <b>A</b> to <b>B</b>, inclusive. During this part of the game, you will say &quot;fizz&quot; X times, &quot;buzz&quot; Y times, and &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; Z times. Return a long[] with three elements: {X,Y,Z}. </p>",
