	"statement":"Consider the integers between <b>low</b> and <b>high</b>, inclusive. We are going to select a sequence of <b>N</b> integers from this range. The sequence is allowed to contain repeated elements, hence there are (<b>high</b>-<b>low</b>+1)^<b>N</b> possible sequences (where '^' denotes exponentiation). <br /><br /><br /><br /> Out of those sequences, we are only interested in the ones that have one additional property: the greatest common divisor (GCD) of their elements must be exactly <b>K</b>. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given the ints <b>N</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>low</b>, and <b>high</b>. Let X be the number of <b>N</b>-tuples described above. Because X can be very large, compute and return the value (X modulo 1,000,000,007).",
