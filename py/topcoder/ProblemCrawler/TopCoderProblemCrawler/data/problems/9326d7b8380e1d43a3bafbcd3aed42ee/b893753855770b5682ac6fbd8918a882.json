	"statement":"You have N balls, where N is odd. The balls are numbered from 0 to N-1. In that order, they are arranged into a row going from the left to the right. <p></p> In addition to the number, each ball has either the word &quot;left&quot; or the word &quot;right&quot; written on it. For simplicity, we will use the character '&lt;' instead of &quot;left&quot;, and the character '&gt;' instead of &quot;right&quot;. You are given the labels on all balls as the String <b>label</b>. For each i, character i of <b>label</b> represents the word on ball i. <p></p> You will now repeat the following procedure: \n <ol> \n  <li>Choose a ball that is not at either end of the row of balls.</li> \n  <li>If the chosen ball has the label '&lt;', remove the chosen ball and also the ball immediately to the left of it. Otherwise, remove the chosen ball and also the ball to the right of it.</li> \n  <li>Without reordering the remaining balls, push them together to get rid of the gap created in the previous step.</li> \n </ol> The process ends when only one ball remains in the row. That ball is called the survivor. Note that the numbers on the balls do not change during the process. <p></p> Find all possible survivors. Your method must return a String containing exactly N characters. If ball i can be the survivor, character i of the return value must be 'o' (lowercase oh). Otherwise, the corresponding character must be '.' (a period).",
