	"statement":"<p> Given a real number n, a set of points P in the XY plane is called <i>n-squared</i> if it is not empty and there exists a square of side n in the XY plane with its sides parallel to the axes such that a point from the given set of points is in P if and only if it is contained within the square. A point lying on a side or a vertex of the square is considered to be contained in it. </p><p> You will be given two ints <b>nlow</b> and <b>nhigh</b>. You will also be given two int[]s <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> such that the coordinates of point i are (<b>x</b>[i],<b>y</b>[i]). Return the number of subsets of the input set described by <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> that are n-squared for some n between <b>nlow</b> and <b>nhigh</b>, inclusive. </p>",
