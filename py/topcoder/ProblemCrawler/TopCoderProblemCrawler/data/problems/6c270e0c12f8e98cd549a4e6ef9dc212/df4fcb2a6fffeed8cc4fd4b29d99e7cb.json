	"statement":"Many image editing programs have the ability to stitch two images together to form one larger image. In this problem, you will be given two images, represented by String[]'s. Each String[] represents a bitmap, where the ASCII value of character j of element i represents the color of the pixel in row i, column j of the image. Your task is to stitch the two images together. Specifically, image <b>A</b> goes to the left of image <b>B</b> and <b>overlap</b> pixels from the right of <b>A</b> and the left of <b>B</b> overlap. To prevent any obvious artifacts from the stitching, you want to gradually blend the stitched region from image <b>A</b> to image <b>B</b>. The i<sup>th</sup> pixel (indexed from 1) from the left in the overlapping region should have a value of<br /><br /> <tt>((<b>overlap</b>+1-i)*a+(i*b))/(<b>overlap</b>+1)</tt><br /><br /> where a and b are the values of the pixels from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, respectively. Hence, the leftmost pixels in the overlapping region should have values of<br /><br /> <tt>(<b>overlap</b>*a+b)/(<b>overlap</b>+1)</tt>.<br /><br /> In all cases, you should round the pixel values to the nearest integer, rounding 0.5 up.
