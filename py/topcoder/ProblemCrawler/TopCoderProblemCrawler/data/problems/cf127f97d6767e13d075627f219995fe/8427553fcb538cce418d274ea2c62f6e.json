	"statement":"An undirected graph is defined as a set of vertices with undirected edges connecting some of the pairs of vertices. You will be given such a graph as a String[] where character j of element i is a '1' if and only if vertices i and j are connected. Such a graph has as many vertices in it as there are elements in the String[]. Your task is to assign an integer between 1 and the total number of vertices, inclusive, to each of these vertices. You may not assign the same integer to multiple vertices. Your goal is to assign these integers such that vertices which are connected have integers which are close to each other numerically. More specifically, let <i>max</i> be the maximum difference between the two integers assigned to any two connected vertices. You want to assign the integers to the vertices such that <i>max</i> is minimized. You should return that minimum <i>max</i>.",
