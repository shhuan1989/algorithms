	"statement":"<p> A construction worker was assigned the task to build a chimney. The chimney consists of N layers of 4 bricks each. Each layer, when looked at from above, looks like this: </p><pre>\n  Layer 1      Layer 2\n+-----+--+   +--+-----+\n|  1  |  |   |  |  B  |\n+--+--|2 |   | A+--+--+\n|  |  |  |   |  |  |  |\n| 4+--+--+   +--+--+C |\n|  |  3  |   |  D  |  |\n+--+-----+   +-----+--+\n</pre><p> Each layer, except the bottommost one, is placed on top of the previous such that the borders coincide perfectly and each brick is placed on top of exactly two bricks from the layer below. In the example above, brick A is placed on top of bricks 1 and 4, brick B on top of bricks 1 and 2, C on top of 2 and 3 and D on top of 3 and 4. </p><p> A brick in a given layer can only be placed after both bricks below have already been placed. Of course, bricks on the bottommost layer have no such restrictions. There are many orders in which bricks can be placed. For instance, if only 1 layer is to be placed, there are 4! = 24 possible orders, because any order of the bricks is valid. However, when more layers are used, not every order of the total number of bricks is valid. </p><p> You will be given the total number of layers <b>n</b>. Return the number of orders in which bricks can be placed, modulo 1000000007. </p> ",
