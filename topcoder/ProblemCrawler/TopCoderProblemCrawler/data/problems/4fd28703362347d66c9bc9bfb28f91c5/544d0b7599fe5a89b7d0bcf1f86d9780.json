	"statement":"<p><i>NOTE: This problem statement contains subscripts that may not display properly if viewed outside of the applet.</i></p><br /><br /> <p> In mathematics, an arithmetic progression or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference of any two successive members of the sequence is a constant. For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13... is an arithmetic progression with common difference 2. An arithmetic sequence can always be represented as a<sub>n</sub>=a0+n*d. </p> <p> You will be given a sequence <b>seq</b>, where <b>seq</b><sub>i</sub> = [a<sub>i+1</sub>] for some nondecreasing arithmetic sequence a (both indices are 0-based). [x] denotes the floor function (see Notes). The sequence a is defined as <b>a0</b>+i*d. Return the minimal possible value for d. If no possible value exists for d, return -1 instead. </p>",
