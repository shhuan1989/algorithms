	"statement":"You are planning to release a new product on the market and you want to find a strategy that will maximize your profit. That strategy will include fixing the optimal price for the product. You have made a customer list containing the maximum price each potential customer is willing to pay. You also know how much it costs to deliver the product to each of those customers. You are responsible for paying all the shipping costs, so if it's too expensive to deliver the product to a customer, you can choose not to sell to that customer.<br /><br /><br /><br /> You will be given int[]s <b>price</b> and <b>cost</b>, where price[i] is the maximum price customer i is willing to pay for the product and cost[i] is the cost of delivering the product to customer i. Return the price for the product that maximizes profit. If there are multiple such prices, return the smallest among them. If it's impossible to achieve a positive profit, return 0.",
