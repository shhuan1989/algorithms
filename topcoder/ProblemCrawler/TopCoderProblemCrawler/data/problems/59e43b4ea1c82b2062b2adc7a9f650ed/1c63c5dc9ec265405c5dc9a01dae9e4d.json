	"statement":"Taro and Hanako like potatoes very much. Today they decided to play <i>Potato Game</i>. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Initially there is a box containing <b>n</b> potatoes. Taro and Hanako alternate turns, and Taro goes first. In each turn, the player must eat some potatoes from the box. The number of eaten potatoes must be a power of four, i.e., 1, 4, 16, 64 and so on. The first player who cannot eat a valid number of potatoes loses. Return the name of the winner assuming that they both play optimally. ",
