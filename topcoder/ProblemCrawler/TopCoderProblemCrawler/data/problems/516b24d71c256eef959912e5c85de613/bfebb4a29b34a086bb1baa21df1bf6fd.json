	"statement":"Princess Elly recently discovered secret plans for building a whole bunch of new death stars. Now she and the rebels are desperately trying to destroy them before they are fully operational.<p></p> They are sending several ships to destroy the death stars. For simplicity, in this problem the battle will take place in a 2D plane. The distances are so large that we will view all death stars and all ships as points in this plane. All death stars are stationary. All ships appear at their starting positions at the same time. Each ship is a point moving at some constant speed along some line segment, however the speeds for different ships may be different. As soon as a ship reaches the end of its segment, it disappears from the battlefield. (This does not necessarily happen at the same time for all the ships.) The rebels know the locations of all death stars. Also, for each ship they know its planned trajectory, its speed, the range of its lasers, and the amount of energy available for shooting them.<p></p> A ship can shoot at a death star if: \n <ul> \n  <li>The death star is within its range</li> \n  <li>The ship still has energy for its lasers</li> \n </ul> Unfortunately, some defenses of the death stars are already active and prevent multiple ships from attacking the same death star at the same time. Thus, there is one additional rule: \n <ul> \n  <li>No other ship is currently attacking the death star</li> \n </ul> On the other hand, all ships are able to shoot at multiple targets at the same time. Whenever a ship shoots at X targets at the same time, it consumes energy at the rate of X units per second. The ship can start and stop shooting at any target at any time. (The time spent shooting at a particular set of targets does not have to be an integer.)<p></p> You are given a String[] <b>stars</b> whose elements are formatted as &quot;X Y&quot;, where (X, Y) corresponds to the position of one death star on the map. You are also given a String[] <b>ships</b> describing the ships. The i-th element of <b>ships</b> will be formated as &quot;SX SY EX EY S R E&quot;, where (SX, SY) and (EX, EY) give the starting and ending point of the i-th ship, respectively, S is its speed, R is the range of its lasers, and E is its energy.<p></p> The rebels came up with a simple plan: They will shoot the death stars in such a way that the total amount of energy spent on shooting them is maximized. (It is possible that a different amount of energy will be spent on different death stars.) Compute and return the maximum total amount of energy spent by the ships' lasers if the rebels use an optimal shooting strategy.",
