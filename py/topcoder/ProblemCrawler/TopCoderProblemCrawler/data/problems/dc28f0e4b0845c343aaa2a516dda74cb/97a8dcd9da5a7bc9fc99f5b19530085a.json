	"statement":"You are an electrical engineer putting together a prototype circuit in the lab. You need to add in one resistor to finish things up, but there is a problem: you need a resistor with a very exact value, and resistors are generally only guaranteed to be within 5% or 10% of the value they claim to be. You have a few resistors whose values you have measured, and you want to know how closely you can approximate the resistance you need by combining those resistors in different ways. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Every resistor has a resistance, which is measured in ohms. Multiple resistors can be added together to create a new resistor with its own resistance. Resistors can be added in series or in parallel, each way resulting in a different equivalent resistance. <br /><br /><br /><br /> Consider two resistors with resistances R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>. When added in series the equivalent resistance, R<sub>eq</sub>, is the sum of the resistances, so R<sub>eq</sub>=R<sub>1</sub>+R<sub>2</sub>. When added in parallel, the equivalent is given by R<sub>eq</sub>=1/(1/R<sub>1</sub>+1/R<sub>2</sub>)=R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>/(R<sub>1</sub>+R<sub>2</sub>). Combining more than two resistors with the same operation (parallel or series) is the same as combining two of the resistors, then combining the result with a third resistor, then combining the result of that with another resistor, etc. <br /><br /><br /><br /> As an example, consider three resistors, with resistances of 2, 3, and 5 ohms. The 2 ohm and 3 ohm resistors can be added in series to create another 5 ohm resistor. Those two 5 ohm resistors could be added in series to create a 10 ohm resistor, or in parallel to create a 2.5 ohm resistor. You could also add all three original resistors together in parallel, in that case your new resistance would be R<sub>eq</sub>=1/(1/2+1/3+1/5)=30/31. <br /><br /><br /><br /> By combining resistors in different combinations, you can get many different equivalent resistances. Given a String[], <b>resistances</b>, which represents the resistances of all of the resistors you have, and a double, <b>target</b>, return a double which is the closest resistance to <b>target</b> that can be made with the values in <b>resistances</b>.",
