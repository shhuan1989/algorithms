	"statement":"It is a known fact that of all numbers, 4 is the one that brings the worst luck. It is for this reason that when generating number sequences, we need to avoid patterns related to the number 4 as much as possible.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> You are given a long <b>n</b>. Count the number of positive integers that satisfy all of the following conditions:<br /><br /> <br /><br /> \n <ul>\n  <li>The number contains at most <b>n</b> digits.</li> \n  <li>The number does not contain four consecutive '4' digits. For example, 43444124 is allowed, but 45444474 is not.</li> \n  <li>The number of digits in the number is not a multiple of any of the integers greater than 10 that contain only '4' in their decimal representations (44, 444, 4444, 44444, ...).</li>\n </ul> <br /><br /> Return the total count of these numbers modulo 1000000007.",
