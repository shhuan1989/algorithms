	"statement":"<p>Fox Ciel has a map of some underground ruins. It describes the position of several jewels and their values. She wants to collect some of the jewels. The map is a rectangle with width <b>W</b> and height <b>H</b>. It contains <b>W</b>*<b>H</b> cells. The cell in the upper left corner has the coordinates (0,0) and the cell in the lower right corner has coordinates (<b>W</b>-1,<b>H</b>-1). There are <b>jewelCount</b> jewels. The i-th jewel is located at coordinates (x[i],y[i]) and has a value of v[i]. 0, 1, 2 or more jewels may be in the same cell.</p> <br /><br /> <p>Ciel starts from any cell in the top row (any cell whose y-coordinate is 0 and x-coordinate is arbitrary). She has a super drill so she can move down any number of times, but she can move to the left or right at most <b>LR</b> times. Moving up is not allowed. She collects all the jewels in a cell by moving to that cell (or starting in that cell). Moving down takes <b>timeY</b> seconds and moving left or right takes <b>timeX</b> seconds. Collecting jewels takes no time.</p> <br /><br /> <p>Calculate and return the minimum time required to collect enough jewels so that the sum of the values of the collected jewels is greater than or equal to <b>goalValue</b>. If she can't collect enough jewels then return -1.</p> <br /><br /> <p>You can calculate x[i], y[i], and v[i] as follows:</p> <pre>\n    x[0] = (<b>seeds</b>[1] * <b>seeds</b>[0] + <b>seeds</b>[2]) mod <b>W</b>\n    y[0] = (<b>seeds</b>[4] * <b>seeds</b>[3] + <b>seeds</b>[5]) mod <b>H</b>\n    v[0] = (<b>seeds</b>[7] * <b>seeds</b>[6] + <b>seeds</b>[8]) mod <b>seeds</b>[9]\n    for i=1 to <b>jewelCount</b>-1:\n        x[i] = (<b>seeds</b>[1] * x[i-1] + <b>seeds</b>[2]) mod <b>W</b>\n        y[i] = (<b>seeds</b>[4] * y[i-1] + <b>seeds</b>[5]) mod <b>H</b>\n        v[i] = (<b>seeds</b>[7] * v[i-1] + <b>seeds</b>[8]) mod <b>seeds</b>[9]\n</pre> ",
