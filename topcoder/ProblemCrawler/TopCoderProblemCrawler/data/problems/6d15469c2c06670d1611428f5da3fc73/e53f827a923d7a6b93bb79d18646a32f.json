	"statement":"<p>A matrix is a rectangular (two-dimensional) array of numbers. A vector is a linear sequence of numbers, a one dimensional array. There are row vectors and column vectors. We use only column vectors in this problem. How to multiply a matrix by a column vector (vector on the right) to yield another column vector is described in the notes section.</p> <p>A right eigenvector, <b>X</b>, of a square matrix, <b>A</b>, is a (nonzero) column vector that satisfies <b>AX</b>=k<b>X</b>, where k is a nonzero scalar constant called an eigenvalue (usually represented by lambda). In other words, multiplying the matrix by the eigenvector yields a vector which is proportional to the eigenvector. For the vectors to be proportional by the factor k, each element of the resulting vector is k times the corresponding element of <b>X</b>, k*<b>X</b>[i]. </p><p> Given a matrix, find the smallest right eigenvector of that matrix where each element of the eigenvector is an integer. Smallest is defined by the L<sub>0</sub> norm, which is the sum of the absolute values of the elements of the vector. The first nonzero element of the eigenvector should be positive (if it is not positive, multiply all the elements by -1). If there are equally small integer eigenvectors, return the lexicographically first eigenvector. A vector v<sub>1</sub> comes before v<sub>2</sub> lexicographically if v<sub>1</sub> has a smaller element in the first position for which the two vectors differ.</p> <p> To simplify this problem, the input matrix, <b>A</b>, will be at most 5 by 5 and will always have an integer eigenvector with L<sub>0</sub> norm between 1 and 9 inclusive. </p> <p> Some valid vectors (L<sub>0</sub> = 5, in lexicographic order):<br /><br /> {0,0,0,5}<br /><br /> {0,0,2,-3}<br /><br /> {1,0,-2,2}<br /><br /> {1,0,1,3}</p> <p> Some invalid vectors:<br /><br /> {0,0,0} vector must be nonzero<br /><br /> {0,0,-1} first nonzero element must be positive<br /><br /> {0,-1,3} first nonzero element must be positive<br /><br /> {-1,2,3} first nonzero element must be positive</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre>\n{&quot;1 0 0 0 0&quot;,\n &quot;0 1 0 0 0&quot;,\n &quot;0 0 1 0 0&quot;,\n &quot;0 0 0 1 0&quot;,\n &quot;0 0 0 0 1&quot;}</pre> <p> The identity matrix, <b>I</b>, is unusual in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. All the eigenvalues are 1, and every nonzero vector is an eigenvector. The first one in our ordering is {0,0,0,0,1}.</p>",
