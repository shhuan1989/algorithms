	"statement":"A segment can be represented as a pair of four integers (x1, y1, x2, y2), where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of its starting point and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of its ending point. In this problem, you will be given a set of <b>n</b> segments, all of which are either parallel to or form a 45 degree angle with one of the axes. Your task is to count the number of unique triangles resulting from their intersection. Two triangles are considered to be different if and only if they share at most two common vertices. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You will be given a int[] <b>X1</b>, a int[] <b>Y1</b>, a int[] <b>X2</b> and a int[] <b>Y2</b> such that each 4-uple of the form (<b>X1[i]</b>, <b>Y1[i]</b>, <b>X2[i]</b>, <b>Y2[i]</b>) denotes a segment. Return an <b>int</b> representing the number of triangles resulting from the segments' intersection. ",
