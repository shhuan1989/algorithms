	"statement":"A plane fractal grows in the following way. At time 0, the fractal is a single white square. During each unit of time, each square in the fractal is divided into an <b>N</b>x<b>N</b> grid of equal subsquares. If the square was white, then the center <b>K</b>x<b>K</b> subsquares will become black (<b>N</b> and <b>K</b> will have the same parity). <br /><br /><br /><br /> For example, if <b>N</b> = 3 and <b>K</b> = 1, then at time 1, there are 3x3 squares, the middle square is black and the rest are white. At time 2, there are 9x9 squares, 17 are black and the rest are white. <br /><br /><br /><br /> <img src=\"http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/PlaneFractal/PlaneFractal2.png\" /> <br /><br /><br /><br /> Return a String[] representing the content of the fractal at time <b>s</b> between rows <b>r1</b> and <b>r2</b>, inclusive, and columns <b>c1</b> and <b>c2</b>, inclusive (all indices are 0-based). White squares should be represented by '0' (zero) and black squares should be represented by '1'.",
