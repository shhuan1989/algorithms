	"statement":"TopCoder Security Agency (TSA, established today) is going to search for dangerous content in the internet. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> There are N candidate websites numbered 0 through N-1. Each website has an address given as <b>address</b>[i]. It also has one or more keywords associated with it. The i-th element of <b>keyword</b> is a String describing all keywords associated with the i-th website. It is formatted as a single space separated list of keywords without leading or trailing spaces, where each keyword consists only of lowercase letters. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> It is known to TSA that some keywords are dangerous. These keywords are given in String[] <b>dangerous</b>, where each element is a single dangerous keyword. For all other keywords it is not initially known whether they are dangerous or not. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> TSA uses the following algorithm to identify all dangerous websites: <br /><br /> <pre>\n  Initially, all websites are considered to be safe.\n\n  While there exists a website W such that it's considered safe and\n        at least <b>threshold</b> of its keywords are known to be dangerous\n\n    Website W becomes dangerous\n    All keywords associated with W become dangerous   \n\n  End While\n</pre> <br /><br /> Return a String[] containing the addresses of all dangerous websites found by the algorithm described above sorted in increasing order of website numbers. Return an empty String[] if no dangerous website is found.",
