	"statement":"<p> Cat Taro and Fox Jiro work with a square grid with N rows and N columns (N is even). Each cell of the grid is painted either black or white. You are given a String[] <b>grid</b> which represents the current state of the grid. Each element of <b>grid</b> represents one row of the grid. In <b>grid</b>, the character 'W' represents a white cell, and the character 'B' represents a black cell. </p> <p> </p> <p> Taro works with the rows of the grid. He will take zero or more turns. In each turn he can choose any row of the grid and perform one of the following operations: </p> \n <ul> \n  <li> Paint all black cells of the row white. </li> \n  <li> Paint all white cells of the row black. </li> \n </ul> <p> Jiro works with the columns of the grid. He thinks that a column is bad if there are more than N/2 consecutive cells of the same color in the column. He is happy only if there are no bad columns in the grid. </p> <p> </p> <p> Return the minimum number of turns that Taro must perform in order to make Jiro happy. </p>",
