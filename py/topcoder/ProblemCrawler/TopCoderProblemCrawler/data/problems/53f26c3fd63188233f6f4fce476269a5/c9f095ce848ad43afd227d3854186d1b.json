Each time the robot stands on a cell, it paints the cell red. </p> <p> You are given an int <b>N</b>. The robot will now make <b>N</b> steps. In each step, the robot will move either one cell to the left or one cell to the right, with equal probability. All random choices made by the robot are mutually independent. </p> <p> Compute and return the expected number of red cells at the end. </p>",
