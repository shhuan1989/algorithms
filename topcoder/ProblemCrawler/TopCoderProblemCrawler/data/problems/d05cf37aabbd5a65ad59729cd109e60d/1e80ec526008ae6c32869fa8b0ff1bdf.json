	"statement":"You have a lot of candles. The candles burn at a uniform rate: if you ignite a candle of length L, it will burn completely in L units of time. You can also ignite a candle at both ends, which makes it burn twice as fast. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You have arranged some candles into the shape of a tree. You want to use the tree to measure time. At the beginning, you will ingite some leaves of the tree (all at the same time). Then you will just wait and watch the flames spread across the entire tree. (Whenever a flame reaches an inner node of the tree, it spreads to all branches that meet at that node.) Note that you are not allowed to light new flames during the process. The time you will measure is the time between the moment when you lighted the fire(s) and the moment when the last part of the tree finished burning. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> You are given a description of the tree as three int[]s: <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>len</b>, with N elements each. The nodes of the tree are numbered 0 through N, inclusive. For each valid i, there is a candle between the nodes <b>a</b>[i] and <b>b</b>[i] with length <b>len</b>[i]. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /> Let X be the number of different times you can measure when following the above procedure. Compute and return the value (X modulo 1,000,000,007).",
