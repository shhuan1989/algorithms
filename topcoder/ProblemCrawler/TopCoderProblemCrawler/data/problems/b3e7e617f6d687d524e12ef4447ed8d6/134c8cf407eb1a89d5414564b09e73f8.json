	"statement":"Mr. Agent has entered a government library where secret documents are stored. Documents are stored in different rooms, and each document has a list of user groups that can access it. In order to access a document, a person must have access to the room in which the document is stored and also be a member of at least one user group with access to the document. Your task is to determine the number of documents Mr. Agent can access. <br /><br /><br /><br /> You are given a String[] <b>userGroups</b>, each element of which is the name of a user group in which Mr. Agent is a member. You are also given a String[] <b>roomRights</b>, each element of which is the name of a room to which Mr. Agent has access. The documents are given in the String[] <b>records</b>. Each element of records is formatted &quot;document_name room user_group&quot; (quotes for clarity), where document_name is the name of a document, room is the name of the room where the document is located, and user_group is the name of a user group that has access to the document. If multiple user groups have access to a document, there will be an entry in <b>records</b> for each group. All documents have distinct names, all rooms have distinct names, and all user groups have distinct names. Return the number of documents Mr. Agent can access. ",
